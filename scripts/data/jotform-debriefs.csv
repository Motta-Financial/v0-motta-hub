He opened the call by saying he was very close to cancelling because he really didn't have time for it with how the markets doing.........

The good news is we don't need to do any extra accounting (as of now) - below is a breakdown of the different LLCs - 

• Clay Cornette life enterprises – houses his rentals, he said he has 2024 accounting done and he’ll send us the docs
• For honor – personal fund, not conducting business itself, it’ll get 1099s for stock portfolios, a piece of real estate sold out of it (Hoy Lake) in 2025 (will be sch D)
• Lira consulting LLC – carolayne's cleaning, nothing in 2024

Clay is going to send us the prior accountants contact info so we can get the rental financials because he says they've already been done for 2024. I looked at the zip file he sent and the rental folder just had bank statements, so we'll need to reach out to them. the rentals are also a 2025 book keeping prospect because he said it hasnt been done at all for 2025.

I also requested a POA for both him and carolayne so that we can eliminate some of the back and forth with doc requests with them.

He's also still concerned about all of the crypto gains and wanting to find a way to offset them. there's not really a magic fix for this but i told him that Dat and I are brainstorming on it and we can regroup with some ideas after the 2024 tax returns are done

Next Steps:
- POA is requested and instructions are STC
- I followed up with Carolanye since she didnt show up to the meeting she scheduled for herself
- waiting on accountant info to get 2024 rental financials
- accounting to review the zip file he sent and let tax know if theres anything of concern/note
- accounting to set up a time to meet with clay to get third party access to his accounts",https://app2.karbonhq.com/4mTyp9lLRWTC#/work/4wk2PWDvjTd9/details,,,"assuming that the rental financials are actually done, then we dont need any proposal adjustments. but TBD on that.",0,

So from what I understood, they order material for the syrup substance which goes to Chris and then he creates.  Once that is completed, they send the syrup substances to Space Station which does the manufacturing and testing for the completed products.  After finalizing, Space Station then ships the final product to Nabis where it stores and records the inventory of their SKUs and is distributed from there.  There doesn't seem to be any formalized tracking in the raw material phase which think needs to be ironed out.  He also mentioned the distillate which typically they order at the tail end of the production process given it's short shelf life.

From a tax standpoint, he had an SCorp but paid $40k in SE tax.  Lots of issues but talked to Caroline and if we just look at the 2022 and 2023 amendments in a vacuum to just move Schedule C to SCorp and get back the SE tax, it'd take about 5-6 hours. 

For Accounting, there seems to be a ton wrong which could impact the tax number favorably or unfavorably.  I requested statements but he said there is some drama in trying to get that so might be a heavier lift than we think. 

He said 2022 might be tough because it was a lot of paper documents dropped off to the tax lady.  I'm thinking we fix 2023 and 2024 from an accounting standpoint the best we can to essentially clean up the books and get compliant but I'd rather focus on getting him set up for 2025 vs trying to make previous years perfect cause we're already saving him $40k in taxes.",https://app2.karbonhq.com/4mTyp9lLRWTC#/work/2srh62F1XSs,,,"Proposals:

He got 339k of proceeds for some of the previously exercised ISO's. his AMT credit covers the majority of the tax due and he's only going to owe $10,355 (all NIIT) on the LTCG.

We went over that from a tax stand point and I sent him an estimate voucher along with the excel calc & he's going to pay the full 10,355 now to avoid interest/penalties. 

He is also ready to submit 2024 taxes - he just needs to sign, I already re-sent him the draft and the docusign so that should get filed soon. He is going to make the payment on his own through the irs website (i attached instructions on it).

Looking ahead - he now has roughly 74k of AMT credit that he's still carrying over after this tender offer so the plan is to try to get those ISOs out and diversify with Ross. He explained to use that SpaceX makes the ISOs really appealing (they double/triple the amount if you go with ISOs instead of RSUs) so that's why he has a lot of them. He said the past few grants he's been asking for RSUs to try to avoid the tax mess. 

He's also trying to launch some sort of rocket the past few days and the weather has been getting in the way, they're trying again this afternoon.

I talked to him about us doing it for him but he said he already has too many accounts between Canada / US so he'd rather keep the accounts where he has his bank account (Chase).

They have been making a big push to fix all the little bugs so appreciated the feedback, they are launching the CRM next week. Their whole time has been putting in crazy hours, so hes ready for the launch for things to slow down a little bit but needs to get out and sell as well. Said they had 25 advisors in the Beta. They have 2500 advisors using the pageport video software but because of compliance and agreements wont be able to cross sell them for a while until they can get on firms approved tech list.  They will be targeting all RIAs to start like Motta Wealth Management. 

The price point is going to be $150 a month. He gave us discount so it will only be a $100 a month for the first year, I said that would be great.  They wont start charging the monthly fee until October.  

He mentioned again that he would be looking to do his taxes with us.

Biggest question was his ROTH Conversion and ROTH 401k.  He said he was on purpose because everything he learned in school and based on his math, doing the ROTH now and creating a post tax pocket early will still net positive in the long term despite the 35% effective tax rate.  

He rolled $46k from his old Traditional 401k from Disney/ESPN to his ROTH 401k at E&Y and converted it to ROTH in the process.  He's going to owe roughly $20 - $25k in taxes as of now but he understands why.  

We talked through other strategies such as Maxing his Pre Tax 401k out (if that'll impact his tax rate a lot) and if the SALT limitations go up to $40k.  

He sent us all the paystubs for the year so think we can use the Tax Estimator tool on this one.

I'd say we turn his recurring work item to ""TAX | Advisory (1040) | Steil, Tyler | 2025"" and that'll be a repeating work item.  

Not sure what we billed him for previously but let's do the $100 upon completion.  He won't need quarterly estimates but Dat to put a meeting on the books for October and then in April.  We'll bill him at that point.  

I'm pretty sure the 2025 return was part of the assessment but if not, we can include in the advisory plan.  He's an easy W2 so not a heavy lift plus he'll probably be a Financial Planning client as well. I'm sure he'd be the type to max out a backdoor ROTH every year.",0,NV_JACOBSON_CARY_0522

One thing to note is that the had another tender offer earlier in the year where he saw Cap Gains of ~$775k which we didn't factor into the plan (Not sure why they didn't bring this up earlier but okay).

He started working again and had a heavy month in August but says that he anticipates to make $25k - $30k per month with his new job.  He also says he has a 50 mile commute each way to work which is tough but they are building whatever kind of government building he needs to work in closer to him which will help.  

Ross talked through financial planning with him and mostly on budgeting because they are living a very boujee life right now which Russ understands.  He had 3 open heart surgeries and left his old job so it was a ""Treat Yourself"" money. Especially after he just cashed out a million dollars of SpaceX stock.  

Ross is going to build a budget for him and we will use that as a base for salary.  He'll make $100k - $150k so we can estimate a salary based on the 60/40 rule on that front.

Talked about potentially being a partner for payroll and essentially handling any and all processing/management including withholding/remitting taxes and handling notices.

He was very excited about the opportunity and said that he would personally handle our account with everything we needed.  He said that they don't charge an onboarding fee for clients, but that they do a fixed fee of $50/payroll processed, and they have an additional $10 for each state included in the payroll.  That is due to the extra filings they need to do as a result, but again those fees cover all necessary correspondence related to tax issues/notices.  

In regard to relationship, assume we will take a similar approach with Gusto of getting all the necessary client information and then providing it to Bayview, who will then set it up.  

For pricing to our clients, we can either include the processing fees into our bill amount or just have them come out of the clients account directly when payrolls are processed. Personally I think we charge an onboarding fee, and then maybe a $50 management fee since the expectation is the client would come to us with issues or questions, and then we would work with Bayview to resolve them and let the processing fees just hit the client account. Think we use some of our recent new pipeline payroll clients (La Crue / Upirri) as FGAs with what we think would work better.  Once we get those sorted, we discussed potentially moving clients from Gusto over in Q4 if we feel comfortable with the switch

Below is what he provided me as their required information list:

Item 1: Company Voided Check

Please make sure that you provide the appropriate account number for payroll, payroll taxes, and fees for service.  The bank routing and account numbers must be clearly displayed on the MICR line of the check.  If you do not have company checks, please provide documentation that is not handwritten or typed showing the routing and account number.

 

Item 2: Proof of your Federal Tax ID Number

Any document showing your EIN number and legal number.  People also often refer to EINs as an “Employer Tax ID”.  This nine-digit number can be found on Form 941 (quarterly report preprinted by the IRS), Form 8109 (tax deposit coupon), or miscellaneous IRS correspondence.

 

If you cannot locate any IRS documents with your EIN, you can call 1-800-829-0115 to obtain it.  You must be a corporate officer and be in the presence of a fax machine.

 

Item 3: Proof of your State Tax ID Number and Current Year Rate

These numbers can be found on your state unemployment/withholding quarterly filings, or miscellaneous state correspondence. This document must show the state tax ID number as well as the ER rate for the current year.

 

Item 4: Employee Information

Please provide W-4 information (SSN, name, address, pay rate, marital status, number of dependents, hire & birth dates, departments, and per pay deductions (if any)) for every active employee.

 

Signed Direct Deposit Authorization forms and a check copy for all active employees wanting direct deposit.

 

Please provide the following W-4 information (SSN, name, and address) for every terminated employee with earnings this year.

 

Item 5: Completed Beneficial Owner(s) Addendum Questionnaire

Follow this link to complete our BOA Questionnaire: https://www.bayviewpayroll.com/boa

 

To help the government fight financial crime, Federal regulation requires financial institutions to obtain, verify, and record information about the beneficial owners of legal entity customers. Legal entities can be abused to disguise involvement in terrorist financing, money laundering, tax evasion, fraud, corruption, and other financial crimes. Requiring the disclosure of key individuals who own or control a legal entity (ex. Beneficial Owners) helps law enforcement investigate and prosecute these crimes.

 

Item 6: Employee and Company Balances

Payroll Summary Earnings Report by Employee from January 1st to September 30th.  This report should show gross to net breakdown totals per employee for payments check dated in this date range.

 

Item 7: Electronically Signed Service Agreement

Bayview Payroll Services will send you a completed service agreement via Adobe Esign.  Please review for accuracy and place your electronic signature in the required fields.

Pat was asking if Matt had health insurance. We had connected Matt with insurance broker and I know Matt was provided some quote but I dont know if Matt ever followed through on it. So that sucks for Matt.  So he is going to sign up now but not sure if any of the rehab will be covered or might just have to hit his deductible than they will cover some of it.

She pulled out of the fight because she was having lots of pain in her back and her left arm was going 'dead' for hours at a time.  She also didn't think she had full strength in her right arm.  She knew she had 3 slipped discs but she got it looked at and she has bone spurs that are rubbing up against nerves or something.  She is going to a doctor and thinking about doing the surgery.  The doctor says she'll be back in the gym within 6 months of the surgery and she's leaning towards that option and coming back better than ever.  

Doesn't seem like she's going to fight in 2025 so she'll definitely qualify as a RE professional.  I think she has 10 doors and she manages all of them in various capacities.  

She called me because she needed her tax returns and an income verification for a property she came across through Donald ""Cowboy"" Cerrone who is good friends with her.  She said Cowboy's dad is a realtor and that Cowboy made most of his money outside of fighting (which he noted that I told her that's her future).  The house is worth $350k owned by an old couple and they accepted an offer from Raquel for $200k.  She wants to get a loan on it with 25% down and then immediately get a HELOC on it to get her money back for the next one.  She noted it was a trick we talked through for Dan Johnson and we joked about how she didn't know what she was doing on the first one but she's a pro now.  She says she loves it and wants to keep buying them to provide income post fighting.  

She even said Tecia has heard her talk about all these opportunities and is more motivated to get her finances in order.  

Another transition but Tecia isn't fighting for the rest of the year either.  NOT PUBLIC INFO but Tecia and Raquel are trying for another baby.  Last time, they extracted an egg from Raquel and IVF'd it into Tecia.  Now they are doing to use the same donor but to see if Tecia's eggs will hold.  They said there were complications with Tecia last time but just starting the process so fingers crossed. 

Tecia's on a really good run in the 125 division and Raquel's still a contender at 135 but they've both started to have different priorities in life with Alayah and Raquel's new ventures.  

Raquel says she'll get her taxes done by this week because she needs to in order to get this house.  I said the last time we did her taxes was because she needed to buy a house as well so I said I'd talk to her in April.

Mikey got promoted to VP and says he really needs to get his finances in order.  We have talked throughout the year to do all we can from a tax standpoint (i.e. estimating this taxes, maxing out his 401k, etc.) when he got his bonus in May.  

He says he got a $25k increase in base pay and that his bonus will go up but it'll be prorated for his Associate Pay vs VP Pay so it'll be more but he won't get the full VP amount until 2027.  

We talked through things like buying a house and getting married and he's thinking the marriage part will start to happen in 2026 with the house a couple years later in New Jersey in the suburbs.  He doesn't think he'll ever move back to California but who knows.  Anna's from New Jersey and his job is in NYC so think he'll be there for the long run.  

Most of the discussion after we told him there isn't a lot to do on the tax side was on the financial planning side.  He says he has 2 old 401ks out there and he doesn't really know where they are or what they are invested in.  He wanted to consolidated and Mark talked through how consolidating helps make sure he's properly diversified.  Mikey said that's exactly what we're looking for.  

He has $75k with us in a money market and $7k in a backdoor ROTH which Mark can determine if that's a viable tool.  Mark brought up Permanent Life Insurance as well and think that could also be a good tool. He'll be in the 35% tax bracket until he makes life changes (i.e. wedding in 2027 and house in 2029/2030) which he understands but he agreed it's better to start diversifying sooner rather than later.

She definitely can cut down on spending (she knows this) but went through her budget with her and came up with a debt payoff plan for her.

She opened a Chase cause her old bank was regional so think it helps she already has a relationship there.  

The other option I looked into was a Debt Consolidation Loan with Lending Club but think we go Balance Transfer first.  

She also has about $11k in an IRA from the Oakland A's.  She said her dad had rolled her 401k with an IRA with his advisor and she asked if that was an option.  We talked through the penalties / taxes associated with that and told her that our CFP, Mark, would say that's not a wise financial planning move.

Eric is worried that they are draining his 401k at a rapid pace and they need to figure out their fiances and plan for the rest of retirement. He retired with 1mil in his 401k and in a few years it is down to 250k.

He's a Doctor (W2) for MGH and also Brown University.  He works in Internal Medicine and specializes in Obesity.  He's a typical doctor who only knows medical things had doesn't believe in money.  

He's not sure if he hasn't filed taxes in 3 or 4 years so I'll send out the request for his info so that we can request POA.  We'll probably need him to create an IRS online account as well.  

He said he always got refunds before (Guessing before he started making real money) and that he never cashed the checks.  He also needs help with getting those checks re-issued from the IRS.  

He says he's not good at this stuff and is ashamed because he tells his patients to make changes in their life so that they aren't fat anymore and they don't do it and also that he has had people tell him he has to figure out his finances yet he still ignores it which he knows is wrong.  He says he hopes he doesn't exhaust us and I said if he throws us the keys than we will make it as hands off as possible for him. 

He has a thick Greek accent and says he wants to go back September 23rd but he's here on a Green Card and he's concerned that his tax situations will cause complications.  He asked if getting the tax returns filed by then is realistic and I told him yes.  

He's a big soccer fan and going back to see some Greek professional team play in Athens.

"Aug 11, 2025",Prospect/Client,,,,,,,,,,,Work Item Has Been Created,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MA_HIGHLINE_CONSTRUCTION,,Dat Le,"Caught up with Niki who has a full time Controller who she describes as a bookkeeper.  I talked to Kurt later in the evening and I was told it was a particularly bad day cause they found something else (which is good for us obv).  She does everything manually and resistant to growth.  Things are slipping through the cracks and she's burying them in the books.  She's also just not doing the bookkeeping great. An example is that Highline ""TopCo / Mothership / Cash generator"" has a plywood wholesaler but Ellekin (Cabinet subsidiary for Highline which is a construction company) uses a lot of the materials yet there is a $0 on Ellekin's books for 2025.  

Kurt had talked about similar frustrations where he doesn't have the information he needs in order to properly estimate work and the finances around the Cabinent side in general.  Cindy (The controller) also seems wayyy behind on her stuff and doesn't really pay Ellekin any attention because Highline is already overwhelming her.  Kurt says it takes her so long to do everything cause it's all excel spreadsheets.  

Niki was looking for someone to integrate their Business Software (HomeBuilder or something like that) into their QBO which it should do already but Cindy is resistant to change.  Cindy doesn't really come from an accounting background so I'm guessing their processes are sooooo bad.  Although Niki seems super sharp and you can tell she wears a lot of hats.  

They have a Fractional CFO that they are paying right now (his name is Gardner) and he is about 65 or a dinosaur as Niki said.  He suggested the integration overhaul which I think Niki already had in her head to do so nothing earth breaking there.  They basically need to restructure their finance department (Matty used to see me do this when we lived together) where they bring in Consultants (us) to take Cindy's job and keep things afloat for business continuity and as we clean up and install new processes.  They will find a new Permanent resource (whether in finance or Ops and outsource finance to us.. which is a new DLe idea).  

TAX
They have a tax person who is ""Super aggressive"" who they say they like but not married to him.  

WEALTH MANAGEMENT
She also said they have a financial planner they worked with 3 years ago who charged them $3k and they got nothing out of it.  Niki admits they didn't submit the documents they asked for but also because the financial planner made a comment about their credit cards because of their high balance but Niki pointed out that it's paid off every month and it's just the general business line of credit so it goes up and down. Easily can install Mark on the Business and Individual front.  


Niki asked for the following: 

1. What the pricing would look like for a CFO Services engagement for Ellekin.  This would be full invoicing, helping with estimates, and WEEKLY reporting.  Ellekin makes about $1m top line but currently not profitable (although with bad numbers, we don't know if they are or not).  

2. What services we offer and how we might be a better solution than their current set up.  I think it's super easy: 

a. Gardner is old and is going to die soon
b. Gardner is old and doesn't know how to use an iPhone. Asking him to help with integrations is a tall task.  
c. He was going to subcontract out the job to another firm which will be less efficient and not scalable for the business.
d. We can grow as they grow.  If they need more finance help, they have a team that is trained that they can deploy vs having to hire a full time resource or new contractor.  
e. We offer all the things under one roof so it's a one stop shop for them. 
f. We have Dat Le aka DLe3 aka the Big Bad Booty Datty who can help with custom integrations if necessary.  

Overall I just think it makes sense but that's some of the ways we can be better.  

3. She asked for pricing for all of this so we have to be thoughtful about this one because it's a $100k annual job potentially.  We should do pricing for Ellekin by itself (Bookkeeping & Taxes) and then Highline & Ellekin with the thought being that the Ellekin price would be cheaper if we did all of it.  

When I talked to Kurt afterwards, we talked about the benefits of this relationship and how it's a win-win.  He also doesn't think their current solution is going to help them scale and we can do that all under one roof.  He said during the meeting Niki said ""Well what are we going to tell Gardner"" and Nik (husband) goes ""Who gives a shit"".  Kurt also brought up a good point that even if we're more expensive than whatever they are paying Gardner, if we get it done in 75% less time isn't that still better? Good point Kurt.  

We'll debrief as a team but I think this could be a couple of CFO jobs.  They make about $10 million total top line with about $8.7 million coming from Highline and a million coming from Ellekin.

2. Applied for a Refi student loan.  He'll send the screenshots of the options.  Got a base rate 3.75% and 5 year payment term at 4.84% at ~$821 per month.  Went through his budget and he's paying $1k now so basically his payment goes down $200 per month and he'll be free from student loans in 5 years if not sooner.  He has no idea what he's doing with this stuff and had his money in a savings account so think this is a better use of his money.  That's impact people! 

We went through his budget and after all his savings (including the life insurance), he's basically netting $8.5k per month after taxes.  Not too shabby.  

We walked through Altruist and ACTION ITEM for Mark is to delete the duplicate accounts for him.  

We also looked at his 401k and there's still $19k from his Caesars 401k that could be moved to his rollover IRA he already has open with us and his old Roth 401k which he'll probably never contribute to again.  I know 401ks are a higher compliance item so I'll let Mark work with him on that though.  

He was super appreciative of the help with all of the above and kept saying that either me or Mark have to talk to his parents about whatever they have going on because they're definitely not using their money efficiently.

TOMMY POINT to the tax team on this one (Caroline/Grace) who did a Review / Assessment and found like $9k in tax savings.  The old CPA is straight up incompetent which helped us a lot.  Great job to the team on the turn around there.  When I told him she put his Backdoor Roth IRA as taxable, he yelled the F word and said ""Yeah, I think I've had my last conversation with her"".  I said Caroline drafted the return so she can essentially just punch in the numbers but he isn't confident that she could even pull that off so he's asked that we file it.  I think we charged him for a Review/Assessment so we can just count that as the prep since we basically spent that time doing that.  He was super appreciative of that and also I specifically brought up that we've already saved him almost $10k and he said that all of that is coming back to us.  

He says he wants to do the LLC cause he wants to start getting things buttoned up but he's not the guy that wants to do it so it's been procrastinating.  He says he already knows he can trust us so he finally wants to get all of his finances situated.  He said ""I want all of it"" when it comes to planning and all of that stuff.

Matt is a nice guy, I ment him at a chamber event about month or go. He is 25 has his own bookkeeping business only has like 12 clients right now, says he can get his work for the week in only a day so has plenty of room for capacity. He is all quickbooks. Talk about different tech platforms and general business. 

He is looking for a cpa to refer business to, said he might have one client with an immediate need. I mentioned we would keep him in mind for any overflow or potentially white labeling if we wanted. 

He went to unh, does some photography on the side, he likes doing some photos shoots but doesn’t want do that full time so that why he started the bookkeeping firm.

He basically just needed some details taken out because he was concerned about the underwriters so I made those changes and sent the updated draft along to Michael Holt.  

He also said his mother was a CPA and had her own shop for over 30 years and it would have taken her 3 weeks to turn a letter around and it would have been thousands of dollars.  This is to give everyone an idea of pricing and how valuable this service is to the market.  

I talked to Michael and he wants to set up a referral type relationship.  He said that the first person we did a verification letter for plans to use us for taxes.  I don't know if he's just being a salesman but if Brian can find that work item for whoever we did the Verification letter for and add them as a prospect for 2025, that would be great.  These are often times HIMAR clients and they are from a Non-Financial-Advisor so could be a good source of organic leads.

I told Michael these range between $500 - $1500 depending on the scope and how quickly they need it turned around.  I think we say standard turn around time is 1 week but if they need it sooner (Expedited) than it's more money. Caroline/Brian to create that service. 

Caroline, Grace, and I utilized the PDF Services Agent and created a CPA Verification Agent that will read all of the statements, convert to data, create the financials and expense ratios (taking out transfers) and writing the letter to the specifications of the requestor.   (See agent here: https://mottafinancial.anyquest.ai/agent/bf542de4-52e1-4333-bb95-e1a3f4a6e031) I also added it to the Karbon Work Template. 

Furthermore, I created an Airtable form (https://airtable.com/app29FvStmjP1Vyb2/pagggLgnehv2sJED3/form) for future CPA letters.  

My next quest is to somehow get ALFRED to do this process start to finish.  If you think about it already, we can already take a process that takes the industry 3 weeks to do and turned it into a 30 minute exercise.  Try and compete with that.  

Michael says Phillip Morris is HomeSmart's COO and said he'd want to talk about some sort of partnership (think they're just looking for bulk pricing).  Maybe we can white label that service for a ""Set Up"" or ""Licensing"" fee and basically just have this ALFRED Agent be an ATM machine.

Luke is a real estate agent but he's scaled that back over the past year and has been mainly focusing on his advertising and marketing company (ads, websites, things like that). He was incredibly long winded and scattered but overall he wants a one stop shop to handle everything for him. His old/current CPA gives him one word answers and doesn't research things for him - seems like just a prepper, so Luke is annoyed with him and wants someone who cares more about the advisory side of the relationship. Ex. he asked his current cpa about s-corp election and his cpa said 'you don't need to do that right now' and didn't explain or say anything else. the main focus for us right now will be the 2024 tax return because thats extended but not done. i dont think it makes sense to try to late elect s-corp for 2024, think itd be cleaner with the irs to just elect for 2025.

He currently handles his own book keeping and says 'he's pretty good at the day to day' but then admitted to not having 2024 completed...we got accountant access and matt saw that he's moving money out of  the business and into his personal investment accounts etc. so there's going to be a fair bit of clean up there.

He wants the following services:
- tax prep (2024= 1 1040 + 1 state; 2025=most likely s-corp + personal, + 1 state for each)
- tax advisory, quarterly estimates
- wealth management/financial planning
- book keeping - we talked about quarterly and monthly so we can show him prices for each

He asked if we do a bundle of services so lets just pitch the advisory plan for him and then if he wants to pay per service we can do that instead.

for the sheet i think we should do two options:
- one with monthly book keeping
- one with quarterly book keeping

for tax planning/MWM -> we should do a bundled price for the two services that we've started talking about

i'll start the draft of the advisory sheet but matt after you look at his books if you could price the book keeping options with the clean up in mind. think we can just pass the excel file back and forth between our different areas to get the total price built out.",https://app2.karbonhq.com/4mTyp9lLRWTC#/work/4q8hkSH4y8vy,,,DJ Roberts referral and DJ is part of 3PM so if we feel that warrants a discount then we can add it in.

He had told me last time we talked that the company was growing fast and they recently brought in a Fractional CFO.  The CFO was trying to reconcile their CRM (Hometrend or something? Kurt says it's a big one for construction companies) to their QBO and found some major issues.  

Turns out, the Controller was tracking the entire enterprise on an excel sheet and only using QBO for invoicing... all manually.  They found out that she was invoicing clients for Change Orders (as in additional work on projects) because she was overwhelmed / disorganized and she just swept it under the rug.   I don't know the scope of how pervasive this is but think this will be a heavy onboarding job.  

I don't know if the Controller was full time or external.. if they are external than that accounting firm is getting sued.  I think she might have been internal.  If they are looking to outsource that, we can essentially replace that full time worker for them.  Could be a big job for us cause I think we can parlay this into replacing their fractional CFO as well.  

Kurt runs Ellekin which is the cabinet side of the house and says they are about to open a massive shop.  They're in Burlington MA and think they do luxury projects.  Growing fast, Kurt was the first hire and think he said he has a team of like 10-15 people.

He says they've been a commodity but this guy can get it for cheaper?  He is essentially looking for a distributor and would pay Cam commission via 1099.  

What he is weighing is if he wants the TopCo to take care of accounting, payroll, etc. and he gets a smaller commission or he can essentially start his own business and get more commission.  

We talked through pros and cons in depth and Cam will go back to the Company with follow ups.  Jared pushed for getting the full commission and hiring Motta and Cam was leaning that way.   

He'll most likely go that route and will be just him so pretty simple to start but he'll eventually have a sales team and he wants to be as hands off as possible so we'd be doing the commission payroll.  They use stripe with codes for each sales person so think we can somehow automate this but maybe easier said than done.  

He asked if we should start a new LLC but he already has one established that he hasn't done anything with so we can just use that.  Let's just do a compliance check to make sure it's in good standing.  See link and PDF attached.  

I think this is gonna start small but escalate quickly.  Maybe we put a 1 year term on this one? 

If he does go with the Motta route, he'll need:  

1.QBO Set Up
2. SCorp Return
3. Payroll Setup (with more commissioned contractors eventually)

I'm not sure if he'll need ongoing services yet but we'll be onboarding either way.

She started the meeting explaining that she had met us before but we were out of their price range in the beginning. Now that they've grown, they have also outgrown their tax prepper - and they are coming back because now they are really looking for tax advisory and not just prep. Antonio spoke highly of our advise and how we're doing quarterly estimates - so that was nice to have that work payout in this way.

They have EXPLORINGNOTBORING BLLC and Robynhood LLC. ENB is the operating business and Robynhood is the MMLLC they created this year to hold ENB. ENB has two partners (1065 Partnership return) -> the CTO that vested this year and holds 5% and ENB that holds the remaining 95%. Tax and entity structure is definitely foreign to her, so we walked through their setup to explain how everything should be working which she appreciated.

She wants to know if they should convert Robynhood into an S-Corp which could be the move, but we want to see the P&L for ourselves first before we lock into that. 

They're going to be going from 100K TOPLINE in 2024 to 500K TOPLINE in 2025. We then asked about profit and she thinks it should come in around 300K for 2025. 

She wants tax prep but she also wants advisory, so this might be a good one (depending on how the discovery docs look) to pitch advisory to right away. She wants to start paying estimates so the estimated tax work will be starting pretty much once they sign on. She also noted at the end that she wants advisory in her proposals and 'she's happy to outsource us for that' aka she seems like she'll throw us the keys at least for tax.

Brian - can you please create the following work items:

- EXPLORINGNOTBORING BLLC: 2025 1065 tax return
- Robynhood LLC: 2025 1065 tax return (might switch to s-corp but lets keep it as 1065 for now)
- Kaysie's 2025 personal tax return
- Tosh's 2025 personal tax return (we have this one already)

In terms of proposals we need the following (subject to change when discovery docs come in), but lets also have an advisory sheet prepped so that if we want to pitch that we can.

- (2) 1065 partnership returns
- (2) 1040 tax returns + 1 state for each (i think we can do a small discount since they're doing the business returns with us)

She actually failed to file his taxes 2 years in a row.  The first year she said it got mixed up on papers so he gave that a pass and the second year she just failed to push the file button.  He found this out when he was trying to get a mortgage and they said he didn't file is taxes.

Looking to redeem SpaceX Shares with tinder offer by Aug 12th.  Motta Team is working on Stock Comp Tax Analysis. This will be delivered by end of week. 
His former Financial Planner, had a lot of knowledge on Spacex, the SpaceX CFO used them as a financial planner as well
His former Financial Planner, was impossible to get a hold of, no formal financial plan was made, they would meet to discuss taxes and tinder offers a couple of times a year. Planner filed his taxes and did financial planning for him, (what he is calling financial planning, doesn't seem like they did much.)
Wants to diversify out of Spacex, he loves SpaceX but doesnt want to be 100% in it, old planner was for him keeping all the SpaceX stock for the upside
I mentioned $3900 annual fee for financial planning, he seemed fine with that number, said it was in the ballpark of what he was paying before
Wants/needs to set up investments accounts, has company 401k and Traditional IRA with 6k.  I explained to him the difference between Traditional IRA and Roth.
Overall his goal is better communication, making a plan and setting up investment accts for diversification.

General note, his student loans have high interest rates, which Cary is a little upset at his dad by. I notice his loans were variable rate loans, so when his father signed up for the loans they probably  had a good rate, but with the rising rate environment we experienced, it was just a really poor time to have variable rates loans.  Im sure his father never thought to look at the loans again or even remember they were variable rate,]just signed up for the cheapest rate at the time and didnt pay attention when rates rise, which im sure the student loan company was counting on.

We talked about her ""Egg donation"" which I was confused about at first because there was a $40k payment when I pulled her IRS info.  I thought she had chickens and she donated eggs but I didn't understand why she'd get $40k for that.  I found out it was for her lady eggs.  She said she called the office and they had changed ownership so she couldn't get the form but I said we found it via the IRS tax pro.

He was the guy that asked about our Google Reviews after I sent our intake form so I was going to let that lead die because I thought he was going to be a high maintenance guy but he's actually pretty chill.  

He also started the call by saying he did research on me and listened to the Podcast I was on with Gibson Sotheby's so that BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT I did last year with that pod cast is paying dividends now.  He probably Google'd me and it probably came up under real estate so starting to become a ""Thought Leader"" which could be a good base to be a social media influencer.  He also says I came highly recommended from Chris Martin.  

He was skeptical because his current CPA is a complete moron. It's Ginny from Mountain Bookkeeping & Tax Solutions (https://www.mtnbookkeepingllc.com/).  He did a screen share and she does use Karbon but he says she's manual and slow.  He also said that he first said he owed $80k and that she got him down to $70k but then he talked to someone else and went to her office to do the return live. Turns out, she made some rudimentary error and he said it generated a $6k refund? She also sent all the docs without the password which frustrated him (I don't know if he checked the Karbon task so might have been user error) but it shows that once you make one mistake, the clients are on super high alert for your stuff.  He then said she tried to upsell him the Advisory services.  He said she charged him $1k to do his return and he was more on the side of asking for that money back vs paying her more money.  

Had a long conversation with him about his income.  He worked with Chris Martin while at Oracle in Burlington but then moved to CO then reconnected with Chris after Chris moved out there.  

SCHEDULE E (Rental Properties): 

He has 3 doors (2 units) in the Lawrence area, 1 property in Colorado, and he's building an ADU (90% done) on his primary home.  He says he sometimes AirBnB's his Primary home as well. 

Ginny said he should open Quickbooks and he was out on her so he wasn't about it but he said if we recommend it than he'd do it.  He uses a property manager who tracks income/expenses and he says he spends 2-3 hours at the end of the year working on it so I said Bookkeeping probably isn't necessary because the Property Managers already do it so the only value would be to get live info in a cloud based platform but it's a rental property so it's pretty flat (from an income / expenses standpoint) anyways.  

He hasn't filed his taxes yet but he already has them just about done, Ginny just has to hit file but he doesn't trust her.  I told him we could basically ""Prep the return"" and see if there's anything else that she may have missed.  Let's have that be the project for now.  He has all of his tax docs so he'll send that over. 

SCHEDULE D: CAPITAL GAINS

John has made $300k in REALIZED gains in 2025.  He's really into Ai stocks and also just follows Trump trades.  He also had 1 BTC.  He is REALLY into day trading and admits he's one of those people who will tell you about his Robinhood account.  At least he's making money.  Ginny actually said his return takes so long because she manually inputs all his trades.  He knows he's going to owe like $30k in taxes from that (so far).   

He'll be a heavy Schedule D client so factor into 2025 Advisory pricing. 

He doesn't have the properties in an LLC right now so he said that will be on the to do.  He says he's terrible with all this accounting stuff so I gave him our typical rizz on that.  A lot of our approach seemed to resonate with him in general.  

So I said we'd collect all of his 2024 tax docs and ""Do the return"" but Ginny will push the button since he already paid her to do that.  We'll use the 2024 docs to do a FULL discovery for an advisory model.  Brian/Grace (with Caroline oversight) can put that together.  I think this could be a good FGA for Grace to prep as well. 

Let's send discovery docs for 2025 and in the 2024 tax return request, ask for the draft that Ginny prepared (he emailed her for the password when we were on the call) as well as his ""Tax Docs"".  

Ask him to send any other docs he wants to share as well.. I'm sure he's going to dump a bunch of shit.  Maybe reference the costs related to the ADU, we're gonna need it anyways and I said that there are some energy credits he could leverage before they go away.  See the new service for Energy Credit Analysis in the fees below.  

He said ""That's exactly what I need"" about the following things: 

1. Doing a review of his 2024 taxes so that we won't have to re-do it because Ginny fucked up.  
2. Bringing up stuff like the Energy Credits because we saw he was building a house. 
3. Get the 2024 return done, he was anxious they weren't filed yet because Ginny was so slow.. he had to file the extension himself.
4. I said we can sync up after we do our review and then come up with an Advisory Model to talk through for 2025 forward.  He wanted to do Tax Planning basically and I said the whole ""Let's review 2024 and we'll come up with recommendations / services for 2025"".",https://app2.karbonhq.com/4mTyp9lLRWTC#/work/3fMpk8MRGGRh,,,"Let's send a proposal for a Tax Review and Assessment.

Her paystub all looked good and we told her that if she gets any additional bonuses or if something changes to let us know, but as of now everything is being withheld properly. Her tax rate is low and her relocation bonus was withheld at the standard 22% which is above her rate so that helps from the w-2 side. The big outlier with her income is her self employed income from her business - she is going to get us an estimated # for income and expenses so we can see what the SE tax implications will be for 2025.

Her LLC is for her resale business (she does designs and then gets them screen printed and sells them to stores). She currently moved the business' address to her boyfriends address in Peabody for the meantime while she was moving to WA. She wanted to know what options she had for the LLC now that shes in WA and we originally were going to shut down the MA LLC and re-open a new WA LLC - but on the call she told us that her screenprinter (who prints and ships all of her orders) is in MA so she still has nexus in MA. It now looks like she'll need to go the foreign LLC route and register her MA LLC as a foreign LLC in WA since she is still doing the designs running the business in WA (so she has WA nexus there by 'operationally conducting the business' there). 

Follows ups:
- Christina is going to send us her YTD income/expenses for the business 
- Caroline/Mark to follow up after reviewing the YTD income from the business and send her the information on the foreign LLC process",https://app2.karbonhq.com/4mTyp9lLRWTC#/work/2PJntgp1qssD/tasks,,,n/a,0,

We discussed payroll and the logic behind why its important and also how its required by the irs when you have an active s-corp. He likes the idea of budgeting and paying in some to the IRS throughout the year to avoid the big year end tax bill so it was an easy conversation. I told him we use Gusto since it is a no-frills service but they'll file everything for you for a reasonable price. I need to send him two proposals - one for just payroll set up/onboarding and a second for if we did everything for him. 

Next was tax estimates - i explained the two ways to do it (safe harbor vs based on actuals) and how estimates will prevent the year end underpayment penalty. He likes to stay liquid so he was wondering if he could kind of pay what he wanted which we explained was also totally fine - just wanted him to know if he had a tax bill at year end then that means underpayment penalty. I said I'll send him both proposals (safe harbor vs actuals) and he can think about it - its likely that he might just pass on these and have a year end tax bill because its personal preference.

Mark then went through retirement plan options with him and explained all the different types and options - the SEP makes the most sense for him and it will only help at year end tax time. Mark also offered the money market account to him since he doesnt like having the money just sitting in his bank account (and he mentioned he was looking at HYS options). Mark is going to follow up with Matt to set up a time for next week to get everything set up.

Finally circled back to the 501c4 org that he's now running with Ellie & he wants us to handle the taxes for it. The name is ""Workforce Housing Coalition"" and I guess they brought on matt and ellie to lobby for them and its centered around housing - he also said basically all of the money they raised is going to him and ellie to lobby for them. They started it Nov 2024 so he didn't realize that the tax return was due in May.  i told him that if they get a failure to file notice then we should be able to get it abated because 1. 501c4 and 2. they genuinely didnt know that they had to file for the two months. he said to make the proposal out to the business name and then he'll present it at this months budget meeting to get done asap since its already late. ill send this one in a separate email to him as well.

last note is he bought a porsche and was wondering if he should just keep that as personal/if it mattered - we told him that if he incorporates it into the business (even just 20%) that it will help his taxes since last year he got a ton of depreciation exp on the cadillac. example i gave is if your entertaining clients and want to use the flashy car then use it and just track the business and personal uses.

To Dos:
- Brian: i dont think we have work items for the following yet. can you double check and create them as needed: payroll, 2025 estimates (the ones for the exempt entity and for WM are already there)
- Brian: two more proposals to make 1. i think our current payroll proposal is for just onboarding/set up with gusto - can you create a second payroll proposal for if we ran payroll for him? then he'll have the two options to choose from 2. can you create a proposal (under the business name mentioned above) for the 501c4 entity tax returns
- I'll then send him emails with the proposal links and explanations like dat did for ellie so everything is clear
- i'll send a second email with the 501c4 proposal seperately

The client is shutting down his S-corp that is Pure Bliss Real Estate but opening, LVTD Real Estate that is a 50/50 Partnership with his wife. LCC is going to manage one rental property the family owns, its a long-term rental so income should be consistent and then just some monthly bills.

The other item the client is looking to do with in this partnership is management the demolition and construction of a ""dream house"", currently not primary residence and wants to take depreciation during construction, need to do some research on this scenario, Amir was onboard with the plan and I believe he is going to be filing the taxes but not sure how aggressive strategy this would be. Also, does the LLC have to own the property, he said the client was open to transferring to LLC but Amir didnt seem to think that was necessary. Want to do more research on this front. 

This will be a brand new Quickbooks set up, no data to transfer. 

Overall Amir is very happy with the partnership and loves Andrew and Matt. He said he only marks us up 100-200 dollars.

(2) Debian Guys Set Up (3) New Business

He's most likely going with Scenario 2 but going with check with EquityBee and things of the sort.  He doubts they'd give him the full Scenario #3 but also said maybe he asks to sell more and they'll meet in the middle.  He's going to look into that.  

Ross said the idea was to diversify over the next couple of years so maybe this is the one we use to pay off the EquityBee loan and he knows there will be 2 tender offers in 2026. 

ACTION ITEM: I think there were some numbers that were off (Owned Shares, Salary, etc.) so think we need to clean up the analysis and calculate based on Scenario 2 in more detail.  I think we also layer in scnearios where they only give him 75% or 50% of the requested shares.  

 DEBIAN GUYS SET UP

Russ said August will be his first full month working and it's been slower because he's taken a bunch of vacations this summer (Noting they went to Europe for awhile and spent too much money at the Louis Vutton store but ""You only live once"").  He wasn't sure about salary and think he's still skeptical because he isn't sure how much he's going to make (or need) so think he's gun shy about that.  Right now he just calls Ross if he needs money and Ross liquidates some of his brokerage.  He said he was going to keep doing that and let the money in the business account sit there but I don't know if I agree with that.  I don't think Ross does either.  I had emailed Ross after to Debrief because I think we're on the same page about that one.  

Also talked through Solo401k because he asked if we needed payroll set up for that but we confirmed that we didn't.  

Seems like he hasn't worked much and hasn't had a lot of business expenses (0 by the sounds of it) so think he's punting on BKPG/PYRL again but this gives us more time to put together an Advisory contract for him and think we have a better idea of the amount of Planning/Advisory that these clients will need.  

NEW BUSINESS

His friend from Unicorn got laid off but his job was to take technology from the Department of Defense and license it out to people so seems like he has some tech that could be something.  Russ says he didn't pay any money in and basically only answers tech questions sometimes (the other guy is the Biz Dev guy) and he's not sure what is going to come of it but he owns 45% of it.  

We told him he might still be entitled to the losses (which would help offset taxes for the tender offer).  That's all we know on that but basically he should just track hours/expenses related to that activity.  Doesn't seem like it'll move the needle overall but maybe this is another prospect and another business to merit an Advisory model.

They used to work together when Russ was at SpaceX and they still keep in touch.  He said he trusts Russ' recommendations and that we came highly endorsed (Thanks Russ!)

Ryan has the same situation as Russ (SpaceX Tender Offer is due 8/12) except he still works there so he usually gets what he asks for in the tender offer.  Russ doesn't work there anywhere and they are offering $1.5b so if there are more people who want to sell, Russ might not get the entire amount he asks for but Ryan will.  

Ryan had an accountant in California but they were taken out by the wildfires in the Palisades.  They got an extension due to the natural disaster but Ryan is not confident that the accountants will be able to file his taxes by October so he asked if we'd be able to help file his 2024 returns.  (Brian - Note that we need to request 2023 / 2022 because we are doing his 2024 return). 

He says he has about $2.5 in total shares (between RSU, ISO, and ESOP) with $2m vested.  He says this is about 80-90% of his net worth and with the favorable tender offer, he was looking to diversify out of his holdings so it's not so concentrated in 1 company.  He says he was thinking about a million dollars but that's because it was a nice round number.  

I brought up how we are doing almost the exact same exercise with Russ and also working with his Financial Planner to see if the amount that we are selling is the correct amount then his financial advisor will invest it into the proper portfolios.  

I brought up the financial planning aspect a couple of times and he brought that up and said he would also be interested in talking to a financial planner.   I said Mark will reach out soon to set up a call because it is somewhat important to understand before the Tender Offer Deadline.

So the old accountant did not respond to 3 of her emails then she finally proposed a time/date for a meeting and he accepted.  Then he Senior Prom'd her.

She says she knows that's important as well but not when you aren't fulfilling your professional duties.  Easiest close I've ever had.  Literally just wanted for other accountants to be ass and then they just come over.  EZ MONEY. 

She sent him a text that says she's transitioning to us because we offer payroll services as well as accounting so made more sense for her to go with us.  

[MAJOR KEY] I think if a client asks us what to say to the old accountant, pointing to our additional service offerings (cause most of our competition only does Bookkeeping or only does Taxes.. and most of them won't do payroll or financial planning).  

Talked to her about requests and it was a miscommunication on my end.  I thought she had filed her personal taxes but didn't report the Schedule C.  Turns out, she tried to file her taxes last year and got an error message.  She was hoping that the accountant could have remediated it but he hasn't done anything.  It's possible he hasn't done anything cause he's not an actual CPA.  

I think she's gotten a lot of sketchy advice (she asked about deduction the cost of baby sitters.. which I think she might be able to get away with since she has a business taking care of children) but she just wants us to take a look and make sure everything is on the up and up.

I did all the calculations through ALFRED (link below and confirmed that Caroline could access it) but did a fill forecast on the following scenario: 

1. If he just liquidated the shares he owns (not likely but wanted to show the implications of just his Owned Shares in a silo).
2. #1 above and Loan Payoff of Equity Bee
3. #1 & #2 above and diversify out of 50% of SpaceX.

Did the analysis and pro forma tax forecast considering the taxes at the various income levels.  ALFRED also wrote memos for all of the scenarios.  

I also did a thorough review of his 2024 returns and something to be mindful of with our clients with a lot of Schedule D income is that the Capital Gains will be taxed at 20% but the total income will be added to the total ""Adjusted Gross Income"" number to determine tax rate.  Meaning if they made a W2 of $100k that would mean they are in the ~12% to ~18% bracket but if you consider the Capital Gains, their total income is $500k thus would be in the 35% bracket.  That means their W2 wages did not account for the investment income thus causing taxes not only on the investments but on total income.

They had $170k in credit card debt and even with both their incomes, probably couldn't afford her mortgage.  Based on his assessment, her net worth was -$300k.  

Since February, he's gotten her almost out of debt with $30k in the back which he promised her when he started on this financial journey with her.  He has access to all her bank accounts and tracked/reconciled all her spending.  Also broke it down to do an analysis.  His conclusion, not enough money coming in and a lot of unnecessary spending going out.  

He had a bunch of questions around the various lump sums of income (Death Benefit, Charity funds, Social Security, etc.) which I researched and put below.  

Also replied to Riley with the research in lieu of a ""Thank You"" email.  We'll be working with Riley on this one and he says it's for our benefit.  He says he loves her to death but there's a lot of reasons why it's better off if he helps provides documents and stuff.  I think we still technically need her to sign for stuff (tax return, etc.) but for now, we're just doing some tax forecasting.  They are still not making barely any money so there's some planning to be done.  

I did some internet searching cause I got some of her details (Name, Job, company, town) and found her contact info so updated her Karbon contact with that.  

I also sent out requests for tax docs as well.

When she first graduated, she moved to San Fran to work for the Athletics then the team was relocating and laid everyone off basically.  She then was unemployed and bounced around jobs for a little in 2024 (as we've seen with all the W2s) including having to live in LA for a few months which she also had to pay for with Credit Cards.  

She was pretty anxious about it but I assured her that there's no judgement here.  She is also not good with all this finance stuff.  

I'll attach the text chain but I will most likely just work through her budget with her and potentially some credit card consolidation loans potentially.  She might have a few 401ks out there so she'll most likely be a financial planning client as well. 

If/when Cary and Jenna get married, it'll be super easy to already have their assets under 1 household.  

I'll handle this one and potentially hand off to Mark (similar to Cary but maybe earlier in the process).",https://app2.karbonhq.com/4mTyp9lLRWTC#/work/4rgv2N5xSFlX,,,"Doing this Pro Bono - This is Dre's girlfriend so I consider this helping Cary.

Also similar to how when we first started doing taxes, we did a bunch of ""Low Risk for No Money FGAs"" to get our reps up with tax prep.. I consider MWM in the same stage right now and think the FGAs we have taken (most recent example with Cary) are good reps to take in this area.  

From a firm perspective, I think we need to think about the ""Tax Prep to Tax Planning to Financial Planning"" process.  Mark and I were talking about making merging those two services under the same roof so Tax Planning can say it includes Financial Planning and Financial Planning can say it includes Tax Planning which will allow us to charge more and make us a superior product in the market.",100,NV_JACOBSON_CARY_0522

Brad / Riley both took it pretty hard and they have two young children so super tragic in general.  I think he was late 30's or early 40's I want to say.  

She's a realtor but I gathered that she only did it part time because of the kids and he was in the electrical union.  

Riley says he's been supporting them financially and that him/Brad split the cost of the funeral because she wasn't going to be able to afford it.

Riley reached out to ask about Death Benefit proceeds from the Electrical Union.  It'll be $10,500 paid out in two payments.  I did ALFRED research which I'll paste below but usually Life Insurance proceeds aren't taxed if the policy was paid for with after tax dollars (i.e. if you buy a policy yourself).  If you get a Group Life Policy through work, those are usually with Pre Tax dollars thus the Death Benefit would be taxable.  

Death Benefit from an electrical union is usually paid for by the members with union dues thus would not be taxable.  I relayed that to him but also asked for the policy or any letter they got to confirm that.  

Riley says she's a realtor and does her own taxes but it gets cumbersome.  I offered to help with the Bookkeeping / Taxes for her (potentially some Financial Planning) to take that off her plate.

When he was home in LA, he asked his parents about his student loans per Mark's request and uncovered some really bad news.  

The original loan was for $125k and he's been paying $1021 per month since May of 2016 (roughly $110k) but the principal is still at $88k.  He was expecting it to be in the 40s.  

The problem is that it was a private student loan and the interest rate is 8.47% (yikes!!) so most of his payments have been going towards interest.  

I used ALFRED (AnyQuest) to research how much he would have saved if he refinanced to market rates years ago and the principal would estimates would be around what he thought (~$40k).  

He said he almost broke something when he found out about this.  He vented about how he knew his parents aren't the best with finances but he was legit angry when he found out about this.  

ALFRED provided some refinancing options but note for Mark to work with him about refinancing those ASAP.  I put the research in the task on the work item. Also attached the paper statement he provided from his dad.

He also said that in talking to his parents, they still have a mortgage of over a million dollars on their home in LA.   He was shocked because they bought the place in 2000 for $300k.  They also just a MAJOR addition to the home when he was in middle school and I'm not sure how much that was for but it seems high.  I think we need to take a look at all of their finances.

Note for Mark they will need a full fee based financial plan.  Friends and Family but when Eric asked me to help with Taxes he wanted to pay for our services because it's business.

MOST IMPORTANTLY: Shout out to the Big Boy, Mark Dwyer for uncovering this.  Shows the value of working with a legit Financial Planner who will force the client to do a full analysis and uncover stuff like this.  Admittedly when I was doing some informal financial planning with him, the student loans wasn't something I really dug into but good job Mark looking into this.  If he found Motta 10 years ago, it would have saved him about $40k in interest.  Think about the opportunities there are out there with situations like this.

Anyways... 

You can get the full brief in the loom but basically he sold out of his 401k from the Brooklyn Nets in order to pay for the move to Las Vegas.  He was explaining how moving was a gigantic leap for him and he had to sell his car / get out of his lease for the job (and related move).  

I'm guessing that he didn't get the 1099R at the end of the year because he was in Las Vegas at that point.  It wasn't anywhere on his Tax Return so guessing it never got to his aunt thus never got on his tax return.  

I pulled the penalty and also the reported 1099s from ProConnect (pretty cool feature) and re-did the tax return.  I need to clean it up a bit but think it's like 90% done.  

One thing that was weird was that the IRS letter said he didn't report this Student Loan Interest Deduction but I see it on his tax return.  It's possible that when it was filed, the EIN or Name didn't match up but I think we have to look into that more.  

Action items are for Grace to draft an IRS Abatement Letter for Sol to get back Interest & Penalties if possible.  We'll need to attached the tax return as well as our calcs (including the student loans that I think they have wrong).  

Grace / Brian to watch the Loom and also find time on my calendar tomorrow to go through.  There are some details to clean up but I can talk through it and maybe finish it.  

It'll most likely take a few months between MAILING them the letter & return, hearing back from them, seeing what the net balance due would be, then Sol can pay that amount off.  We can bill him once we mail the letter out even though this project isn't ""Done"" until we pays off the balance technically.

He wants to start an LLC because he's come across a couple of opportunities to do (1) Financial Literally for a Media company (2) Corporate Mental Health for some firm.


He is looking for: 

1. Single Member LLC with no Operating Agreement.  

2. Registered Agent Services: He wants to use our business address.  

He basically just needs the business registered so that he can get an EIN cause he's hoping to open up a bank account by Friday.  

He asked about cost and said he wants the most basic set up possible.  I said Registered Agent is around $100 per year and that LLCs are usually $500 - $750 (basically the state registration fees and the IRS fees to get an EIN which can vary by state and entity type).  I said if he wanted an Operating Agreement that will range from $800 to $1500 because a lawyer drafts those.  It's a Single Member LLC and he wanted to keep costs as low as possible so basically just Business Registration (under Motta address) and an EIN. 

One thing is that he's a Colorado guy but his client identifier is MA.  Let's check is address and do a full scrub of his Karbon contact as well.  

Brian O to create the additional work item (I'm tagging this to is 2025 tax return for now) and draw up the proposal.  We can walk through how to do LLCs in the morning and record it for training purposes.

I intended to go in there, have some cake and go home, 1-2 hours tops.  I was there for about 4 hours because Kenny kept introducing me to his friends as his CPA and then they asked a bunch of tax questions.  This is why I tell people I'm an accountant, then they don't want to talk to you.  

One of the people I met with Rony Delgarde who is in the same Doctorate program at UNLV with Kenny but a year earlier.  He has a Non Profit that he's been running for a long time where they take paint from people's garage and from commercial projects and send them to Africa.  The 501c3 is called Global Paint for Charity.  

I added Karbon Contacts and LEAD work items in Karbon.  Brian O to add them as Prospects in RP 2026.   

He took a picture of my business card so I'm sure he'll be reaching out soon.  He was floored because Kenny used to be his CPA before Kenny got his license revoked and said he was super impressed with Kenny's work so how good am I where I'm Kenny's accountant and he says I'm the best.  

At one point, they looked at each other like ""Yeah, I think this guy can help us"" so think they'll be coming our way for taxes with the upside of other accounting services + business development.  

The guy was a big fan of me in general and kept on dapping me up.  He was a little drunk I think.

He finally filed his taxes and moving his Bookkeeping over to his mom.

As he's stated earlier this year, he is moving his taxes over to us.  He sent me his personal / business tax returns.  I'll also send an ""Intro email"" with the team and we can request access to his QBO accounts.  

I put together a Tax Plan for him based on our conversation.  Model FA is growing FAST, he says he averages $80k a month in sales and hopes to get to over $100k per month by the end of the year.  He projects that he'll make a million dollars so wants to start planning.  

I did a full review of his tax return and inputted 2023, and 2024 into ProConnect in order to generate a tax plan.  He had his businesses as Schedule C's but also SCorps which I found weird but also think the SCorp election is applicable for all entities.  

He should pay himself a salary and he said he's not sure if Kennedy is going to work once the Baby is born on 9/1 but he wants to pay her out of his business so she can still contribute to a Solo 401k.  He also wants to do a Solo 401k so incorporated that into the tax plan.  

He's made great money over the past couple of years but he's also purchased a giant house on the water in St. Pete's with a ton of renovations and also tons of expenses for the baby but that's just about wrapped up so he's looking to buy some stuff to treat himself... but with business purposes. 

He's going to look at a Mercedes G-Wagon (over 6k pounds) today so we talked through the Section 179 expense on that.  He has a Mercedes S Class or something and he was going to trade it in but might keep it.  I told him if the G-Wagon is 100% business than the Section 179 is applicable and having a Personal Vehicle helps with that.  He says the G-Wagon is 88 inches high and his garage is only 84 inches so he's most likely going to keep both cars with the G-Wagon being solely for business. 

He said he's also starting to look at Yachts worth around $1 million dollars.  He has a dock at his house and has always wanted a Yacht so that he looks like a baller.  He grew up boating with his dad as well and said this has always been on his bucket list.  

He says he wants to hold Model FA events on the boat where he'll charge $5k for clients to come on the boat for a weekend and they'd go to a hotel and have Mastermind / Work sessions.  He said hopefully doing that well help pay for part of the boat and if he does that, he can deduct part of the expenses of the boat as business expenses.  He does hold events like that with the FAs, CPAs, Lawyers, that he works with so having it on a Yacht isn't out of the norm for him.

Dave won't care whatever we charge him but he's provided a 10/10 business development network for us and has helped us a lot.

He was laid off recently and asked me for a recommendation for jobs he's applying to.  I needed a work item to tag it to so figured that I'd enrich the Karbon Client Contact.

Basically we want to build something similar to the Bennewies Stock Comp example.  He has $6.4 million worth of stock with a basis of $350k.  He does have a $600k loan that is triggered that he would have to pay back.  He has a portion of the shares he outright owns and a big chunk that was financed.  

In speaking with Russ, he wants to start to diversify because he's highly concentrated in SpaceX (and from what Ross says, he kind of hates Elon) and wants to liquidate 50% of his shares.  He also got a pretty good tender offer so it'll be a good opportunity for it.  They are at the mercy of SpaceX and the leadership (i.e. Elon) can be mercurial so wanted to sell off so reduce long term risk in a lot of ways.  

He sent us most of the info but we're going to build a Stock Comp Analysis for this tender offer at 50% and also some scenarios (although the current plan is to keep the remaining 50% he has at SpaceX) and also take a look at which shares he should sell if he does sell.  

Ross also says he has able $6.5k in taxable losses from distributions from his brokerage.  He hasn't started his new job so he's been pulling from his savings to sustain life over the past few months.  I think it would have been awkward if we sent the proposals at that point.  He would have paid it, but think it was a better client experience to hold off.

Bookkeeping Services (Monthly)",0,HI_OLA_LOA_SWIM_ACADEMY_0870,,Dat Le,"Had a scheduled 30 minute phone call with Kara that went a full hour.  She's super nice and came highly recommended from Bill Grover of Hanai Marketing Partners.  He also texted me over the weekend to say he's good friends with her and to ensure she's taken care of.  

She's super nice! Hawaiian native but went to school in Worcester and that's where she met her husband who is from Worcester.  She says she loves Massachusetts because the people were direct and no bullshit.  She says she's the same way. 

She has a Swim Academy with 8 total ""Employees"" this year (probably half of that as some come and go.. I asked for total for 1099 purposes) and some more contractors during the summer.  She has no payroll system right now and just pays the Employees/Contractors out of the bank account.  

Accounting team should note that she specifically asked about using Homebase as her payroll system so the team should look into if there's a Homebase Pro account similar to QB, Gusto, etc. for accountants who manage client payroll.  She likes Home base because a lot of her employees are ""kids"" and she has learned that the honor system didn't work as far as tracking hours.  I told her other payroll systems have that feature as well but we'd definitely be able to help set the time tracking part as part of the payroll set up.  

She said she has a bookkeeper and she said the quality was great and that she met with him a couple of times in order to get ""onboarded"" which was great but hasn't heard from him since.  She asked if she, as the client, should be the one reaching out to him.  She also asked where we would be if we had 2 months with her business.   

She said she set up the chart of accounts and has set up the clients / billing files as well as some reports.  She also has pulled all her statements and reconciled her accounts.  She says she just gets mixed up with the categorization of transactions.  I think it'll be a lighter Accounting Onboarding lift.  

She says she's gone over the transactions with him and hasn't heard from him in months and just heard back this week and he said he's been moving.  It's a 1 man shop so she has concerns he has the bandwidth.  She also says that he represents himself as a CPA but she can't find any record of that anywhere which made her lose trust in him.  I explained that not having the CPA doesn't necessarily mean he isn't doing a good job but also think it's illegal to say that you're a CPA if you aren't.  

The business makes around $100k annually and she says she just needs help making better business decisions (like a mini CFO) because swim lessons drop off between December - February and she always finds herself not budgeting well.  Essentially the money comes in and goes out but she's not exactly sure where.  I told her if she doesn't know that, her bookkeeper probably wasn't doing a good job.  

She has an LLC set up that she has never done anything with and then she started another business with a business partner that went south so that business is dissolved.  She asked if she should just start a new one or keep the only one.  I said if we don't need a new one than let's not start a new one but let's see what the old EIN looks like.  Compliance check and potential LLC for Caroline! I told her we'll take a look but if we're going to be setting up payroll, might be a good time to change if we are going to.  

She's 100% owner right now but says she has a operations person who has done a lot of work for free because she knows the business is just getting started so wanted to give her shares of the business.  I said we can cross that bridge if/when we're working with her and the considerations around that.  

She said she's talking to him next week and I mostly said let's see if he's done with his move and what he has for a work product but she was pretty set on moving over to us regardless of how that meeting goes.   She asked what's the best way to break up with him so gave her some pointers there and said we can even help facilitate.  I think we'd just need her QBO and should be able to handle the rest.  

I told her we'd send out discovery requests and get the proposal cooking.  Caroline to send out tax discovery documents.  A-Team, let's hold off on sending QBO instructions until after she talks to her accountant.  It would be super awkward for them to see us added before she told him she's leaving him.",https://app2.karbonhq.com/4mTyp9lLRWTC#/work/3n3b47yGy3ZB,0,,"We talked about pricing for a decent bit because she only had the bookkeeper and not sure what she was doing for taxes but she really liked that we offered Accounting, Payroll, and Taxes all under one roof.  

She asked if there was any packaging and said there definitely was.  Explained that the more a client does with us, the more we can be flexible with pricing cause we'll have most of the information already.   

I think the Work Items / Proposal should be the following: 

1. Onboarding (Payroll - Homebase) - $500
2. Onboarding (Accounting) - $400.  I told her for her, it'd be less clean up and more understanding her set up.
3. Monthly Bookkeeping: $200 per month
4. Tax Prep (1040c): $550. I told her she's around SCorp territory and the considerations around that.  

She really appreciated that the pricing is geared towards a small business because it's super important but she talked to Gusto and said they asked her for ALOT of money upfront.  She said for a new business owner, she appreciates that our pricing is mindful of that and she says she fully understands that when the business grows and there's more work than the prices will go up but liked that we are willing to grow with her.  

She also appreciated the non up front nature because she says she wants to be cause to trust her partners before making a significant commitment although she says she can already tell she's going to like working with us.",0,HI_HANAI_MARKETING_PARTNERS

It was partially to tell me that he's gathering all the documents which might take some time and also he's still sorting out / splitting the businesses with him and his brother.  Guessing their bookkeeping was comingled and he's trying to clean it up before he sends it over.   I told him if we can help with any of that than we're happy to.  

I had texted back and forth with John after which I'll also share but John gave some good intel.  I won't bore you with it cause the texts will tell the story but he's Mormon and also manipulative.  I could kind of tell that from the meeting of a series of tests to see if we're the right fit.  

He mentioned on the intro call that most of his advise will be impromptu so I think today was a test of that to see if we'd be available and if he dropped a question on us, how we'd do.  He asked about deductions for his Hard Money Loan company so I stalled and asked ALFRED quick.  He asked about going from cash to accrual and I sang and danced enough to pass I believe.

John said Barrie provided good feedback on us and that he likes us/me.  He re-iterated that on the call and that he appreciated us taking the time to hop on the phone with him.  Again, I think it was a test.  

We'll wait for discovery docs but maybe Caroline can also reach out and say if it's easier for us to request the requests part from the previous accountant than we're happy to help.

He basically runs the Carpentry and Mill side of the business (which is essentially the whole thing) and said he was a 1 man shop when he started and grew the business to 14 people.  Seems like Kurt is CEO, COO and Nik (see scouting report on the business and business owners) is essentially Chairman of the Board, CFO, President.  Kurt basically runs the business and has A LOT of influence on the business. 

The only reason they offered this was because he had a job offer elsewhere.  He said they went in full panic mode and offered him equity then offered him a pay bump the day after.  Alledgedly they were thinking of doing that already.  

Nik isn't the best business person and says it's newer to him (See debrief on fees for what he's currently doing with the business) and he's good with numbers but he's a contractor.  I said he's good with numbers as far as making a good deal but different skill set when it comes to running a business.  

Kurt thinks this is a profit share and from what I understand, these are RSUs.  My concerns with this ""Opening Deal"" is the following: 

1. Is there a profit share aspect? It says Salary increase + Bonus but discretionary.  

2. Ability to review the financials.  If it's an RSU play, gotta see the value & growth of the business to see if it'll be worth anything.  

3. He's not sure what say he'll have.  He's acting like a principal and feels like the deal / offer should reflect that.  The shares are NON VOTING so he can have shares but he can't really do anything with them.  I think he should at least have the rights to ""Audit"" the financials / tax returns if his compensation is dependent on it and this is their play to get him to stay at this company.  

4. Non Compete - Self explanatory, if it was an actual ownership deal than I would be more amendable but if it's an RSU play than no chance.  

5.  Kurt has grown the business significantly so not sure if the offer is enough for that. 

6. 10 Year vesting term is a lot.. 

Overall he said he needed someone to ""Represent"" him because this is all out of his depth.  I said I would have helped anyways cause he's one of my best friends but want to make sure he's not getting screwed from an offer standpoint with corporate shackles on him on top of that.  I'd say no to the deal as of now.  

Overall I think Kurt wants / deserves an Owner's stake in the company and he's getting heavily restricted long vesting RSUs.",https://app2.karbonhq.com/4mTyp9lLRWTC#/work/2Hqqqf2j65CB,,,"Kurt is going to bring me in as an advisor for his equity deal.  They use a Fractional CFO right now with a bookkeeper and from what I hear from Kurt they are probably both ass.  The CFO is in his 60's and Kurt suspects he does everything on paper.  

It would be aggressive if Kurt said ""Hey, I'm bringing in my advisor to review these RSU grants. Also fire your CFO and install my CPAs to replace your finance department"".  

So we'll ""Comp"" this negotiation and once Kurt gets in there, we'll provide feedback on how we're better and Kurt will then install us into the business.  

I have to be mindful not to be a dickhead with this negotiation because this is basically discovery for a long term Bookkeeping & Fractional CFO services prospect.  Kurt specifically asked if we do CFO services and I said 100%.  

They are probably paying this dude $250+ per hour and no idea what they are doing for bookkeeping.  

Kurt said he has a ton of leverage here (Biz might fold if he leaves) and if he's going to be financially tied to the company, he's going to want to make sure the numbers are crisp.",100,BBBD_LE_DAT_8789

Kurt also just got offered an equity partnership type of arrangement at his company so asked if we'd be able to review it.  I'll take a look at it but also might toss it into ALFRED as a check.  We can also have BB take a look if we really wanted to.  

For background, Kurt started a carpentry business with his father which basically got absorbed by a company and now they are offering him equity in the company.  I'm guessing it'll be pretty plain vanilla but we'll kick the tires on it.  

Kurt also said that the ""CEO"" of the company is a tradesman and is very skilled at what he does but is not a great businessman.  I feel like we hear this a lot...

1. Bookkeeping Clean Up: Mitch is going to do a deep dive in 2023 because Sharon was doing a forecast and her numbers were out of whack because of the accounting numbers so Mitch said he was going to spend the evening re-categorizing transactions.   Half of me thinks this was our fault because of the change of hands in prior year and my neglect of the client during said transitions.  He noted things like HomeBot (which is their mortgage tracking software) was under advertising.  The other half of me thinks Mitch is trying to get cute with numbers because he said he's talking to some company about a merger and the budget/forecast are part of that.  Who knows but think we should level set on the accounting front and do a full scrub of prior year if we can (P24) to clean up vendors and things of the sort.  

2. Glasswing / Sharon - So Mitch hired Sharon (Consulting firm AVL) as part of a bigger deal with Liam (This was going to be a Glasswing JV from the guy who was one of the first employees of Uber) along with his wife's book of realty business.   Mitch says Sharon hasn't done much and that it has taken Liam 9 months to find a loan officer for the Glasswing JV and he has interviewed 2 people during that time.  Mitch said that Liam said for a $100k book of business, it really hasn't been worth his time and Mitch says he's not considering the ancillary revenue.  He said the idea was that Glasswing would have produced enough to cover all of Liam/Sharon's consulting fees but he hasn't even hired an originator for the branch.  


3. Motta New Contract - Point of clarification was that the $19k was for Liam/Sharon total.  He says he pays Sharon $2.5k per month and there was a $5k discovery fee and the other $5k was the retainer.  They still have some time with her but Mitch also said that Sharon was billed to him has having mortgage industry experience and she does not.. Mitch says he's asking for his money back.  He says they are billing her out at $280 per hour and that was WAYYY too high for her.  Consider the updated information in pricing as we work through our proposal.  At $2500 per month that will get him a lot but there still might be taxes on top of that.  

He mentioned that he owes us back pay because we agreed to an additional $50 per branch and I remember those numbers from when Matty was here so a longgg time ago but think we just reset on the engagement in general.   I'm not sure if $50 per JV is the right number anymore but if we said we'd do it for that much before, there's less wiggle room here.  

3. Loan processing - He said he hired a loan processer.  He used Hancock, then moved to some other company, and now hired someone who can do it internally so he might start getting some of that revenue as well.  

4. 3 Point Insurance - Mitch was talking about transferring money between 3PM and 3PI and I said it was fine because they need cash to open the business.  Thinking back, it should have probably gone to Mitch then 3PI because the ultimate idea is to form Three Point Capital where they will all roll up to.  

Weird sidenote but he HATES Thalia.  They had a mortgage process gone poor and he said Thalia said her dad had a 800+ credit score so he based the quote on that but her dad's credit score was in the high 600's which changed the rate.  Part of me thinks he probably sold her on best case scenario but final deal wasn't as advantageous.  Part of me thinks he was laying this in case word got back to us about that deal and that he potentially tried to pull something sleazy.  He went as far as to say he hopes the marriage doesn't go through.  

I would agree that Thalia needs explaining sometimes and a lot of this is difficult for her to wrap her head around but from what I know, she really tries to understand what's going on so I tend to give the benefit of the doubt to her.  Doesn't impact us directly but some tea.",https://app2.karbonhq.com/4mTyp9lLRWTC#/work/vTTfsgXf5vR,,,"Total ""CFO Services"" fees should be a little under the $280 per hour or $2,500 they are paying Sharon/AVL.  I'm not sure how Liam's consulting fees are factoring into this but maybe Matty/OCP research this as we come up with our pricing.  

Mitch says he's probably gonna let Sharon go at the end of the month so let's try to level set on the accounting and meet with them about all of this before 8/1.",0,MA_MARTIN_CHRISTOPHER_7774

Great call though, she's just super detailed because she's nervous about all of this.  She apologized a zillion times for all the questions and mentioned a bunch of times that she wants to make sure what the services are so that she doesn't take advantage of our time.  Super considerate person overall.  

I had put together an Advisory Proposal for her which I think we should leverage more going forward because it helps us from an internal pricing standpoint and think it's an easier layout for the client.  Think Matty and I can refine that template a little more as well.  

She'll be a QBO set up, Quarterly Bookkeeping, Tax Prep (Schedule C for now), and Tax Estimates.  

She basically wants to be as hands off as possible and also asked for help as far as calculating ""If I get paid $100, can you tell me how much I should put into a savings account for taxes? I just want to set it and forget it"".  She'll definitely be an SCorp in 2026 and will need to pay herself a salary.  I suggested once that happens than we do a Salary for all her fixed expenses that go into her personal checking.  Payroll taxes will already be withheld but then the Income Taxes on the Business income into another account.  I think we'll be able to sort it out for her.  She's most likely just going to give us access to all her bank accounts and just let us cook.  She wants to be very hands off in a good way.  

I think if we do a detailed Onboarding with her QBO than we can set up all those things off the jump and just maintain along the way.  Also it'll be good to educate her from the beginning which I think will help with trust for her to really throw us the keys.  

She wanted to start off with Quarterly bookkeeping because she didn't want to overcommit with business dollars and not be able to pay us.  She said ""If we start with quarterly and you guys rock, am I committed or can I ask for monthly at that point?"" I said we can be flexible and adjust as the business grows / changes.  I'll also note she says ""I'm getting expenses all over the place and you guys are the most important one but I just want to make sure I'll be able to pay you guys"".  

I think this will be one of those ""Start small and quickly expand"" type of clients.  She said multiple times she's nervous about all of this and wanted to know that we had her back which I assured her that we would.  

We can get started on the QBO set up immediately so A-Team can get that going.  Caroline already set up an estimates work item as well but she's not putting in her notice until 8/1 and the business isn't going to start until 8/15.",https://app2.karbonhq.com/4mTyp9lLRWTC#/work/4cHvRGrHM9Fz,,,"I'll attach the pricing sheet -  Taxes, estimates, Quarterly Bookkeeping. 

One thing to note is that we talked about getting Bookkeeping clients on billing cycles of the 1st and the 15th so we don't have clients on a zillion different billing schedules.  Let's start to implement that.  

She asked when everything was due so we talked through that.  We'll talk to her along the way but let's do the Onboarding fully upon completion (along with the taxes and estimates) with no deposit.  Quarterly Bookkeeping to start on 8/15.

Left with more questions than answers, but that's typical with Synergy acquisitions.

Ultimate take away is that there should be two set of books, Uinta Physical Therapy & Synergy Evanston.  They technically could be two books run under one QBO Account, but would just need to install classes and put designations on transactions to differentiate them.  Additionally based on the type of transaction, Stock Purchase, they are taking ownership of Uinta's books from inception and thus we would need to get their books provided to us in order to have everything properly recorded. 

Result, I believe we need to meet with Daren and get a confirmation of what the expected intention was with their purchase and convey to them what the actual situation is and see if those two things align, and if not, figure out what needs to be done to rectify it.

Super early into our second year.  It's working! 

Finally caught up with Kenny about the proposal and got him to up the percentage to 2.5% and also for a contract for Bookkeeping / Taxes with Motta. 

He had sent all the statements and I set up the QBO and got it synced (even though I think it was only 2025 so there will be some importing).  If we need anything, Kenny/Damion are SUPER responsive... especially Kenny (maybe even too much).  

We also need to do some forecasting.  I went through their model briefly with the team and it was... not good.  At least if you want accurate numbers.  At least there's data in there.  

We also have access to their Nabis system (Sales and Inventory) so let's make sure we can pull all that info.  

Andrew / Grace to work on Onboarding, Catch Up, and Monthly Bookkeeping.  Matty to lead on the forecasting front with me in support.  

They are also still looking for financing so I had reached out to Blue Street Capital, Steve Femino who pointed us to Clinton Jolley, and also reached out to Kenneth Mooney of SEED to see if he know any funding sources and he mentioned Leaf Link.  

Kenny used to have some Factoring arrangement and and think Nabis/Leaf Link does that service but Kenny said they needed financials and tax returns as part of the application so this is why we're here.  

I'm not actually sure how he's filed this entity in the past so maybe that's a follow up.

Super personable and charismatic guy who will shoot it to you straight and always himself always.  Very genuine and self aware guy and has a sense of humility to him.  I think he understands more than he lets on and partly and act so people skip the boring details and give it to him simply.  

He has a Commercial RE loan company where they do Hard Lending which is people who are looking for Cash really fast for flips and stuff.  So a company will propose a flip, ask him for the money, he provides short term loans, they sell the property, they get their money back and some.  

He started it with his brother who passed away this year.  When he initially brought it up you can tell it choked him up a bit.  His brother was also the finance guy and tax expert so Barrie has gone his entire life not knowing anything and relying on his brother.  He says his current tax guy is a really cheap prepper because he's relied on his brother to be his personal CFO.  He's asking us to do the same for him.  Feels like a Jason Gavan type of situation so advisory for very high net worth individuals.  

He has a bunch of businesses (including this business and Sibi) and said he'd need us to do the Duke Silver LLC (for now.. he says he has other so think this is a try out) and also his Sister in law's returns including his brother's estate.  He also had an old business partner that passed away and he manages the estate for that as well.  Seems like he's taking care of their families which I find admirable.  I'll lay out the returns below.  Caroline is aware of this so I think we'll know more about these Prospects post discovery docs.   

He doesn't need any Bookkeeping because it's a pretty lean business but he emphasized that he needs tax planning and strategizing.  He has A LOT going on and usually just had his brother do everything so he's hoping we can fill that void in his life (his words not mine).  

He asked a bit about fees and said most of his questions are going to be Impromtu and I emphasized that's what we do and never appreciated hearing clients get billed for 15 minute phone calls.  That resonated with him.  

Overall he wants to have that same way of life with his brother where he didn't have to do anything and is very hands off.  He knows it'll cost him money but he's one of those people who wants to be hands off and let the people do what they do.  

We brought up financial planning and he says he's at Merrill Lynch and they have all his assets and the estates assets but he was visibly annoyed because he says they always explain it to him in such technical terms and leads to him having more questions / confusion.  

EMPHASIZING that when dealing with him, we want to basically explain it like we're explaining it to a six year old.  

This could be a financial planning lead for Mark as well.  He doesn't seem overly satisfied with them and said something to the effect of ""Why do I pay you the 0.8% management fee if you're not telling me anything I can understand"".  


ACTION ITEMS:

1. Caroline will send discovery documents with adding some Ad'Hoc requests for some of the other returns he asked us to help with.  

2. Brian O to create a contact for Duke Silver LLC (he took an intake form right before the meeting).  The business contact wasn't created so flag that for Tekyz as well.  

3. Brian O to hold off on the other work items until we get discovery docs.  It will most likely be like 5 work items but we don't have enough details yet.

I doubt he'll be a client in 2025 but he'll definitely be a referral partner and affiliate.  This one might be a good recording for Brian O to watch and read the transcription because this was essentially a Business Development meeting for a new Channel.  

Austin does a lot of things: 

1. He works for Tech Launch Solutions.  I think I had him as a recruiter for Blue Signal but he says he doesn't do that anymore.   Tech Launch Solutions is a NO COST service to businesses to review their IT Infrastructure and Software Licenses and help them build if necessary.   Not like an IT consultant but even Adobe licenses and stuff like that.  He has distribution contracts with 766 vendors where they get wholesale pricing (he says it's roughly 21% off) so he can almost always get the client their same license but for cheaper.  They'll also make sure you have the right softwares / licenses for your business at no cost to them.  They get a 8% - 25% commission off the licenses they sell so it's the vendor that pays them.  

He says he works with CPA firms all the firm because they a warm with business owners, know how much they are paying for IT services, and understand the financial savings.  He was going to send over Marketing Materials, Agreements, etc. 

2.  Titan Consulting.  He basically is a brokerage for all services including CPAs.  Basically he just brokers referrals.  If someone needs a CPA, he sends them to us and gets a rev share from it.  

He says they don't sell but their strategy is to work with channels like CPA firms to get new clients.  He also says he has standing Monthly/Quarterly meetings with all of his referral partners where they bang through a list of referrals for us and we provide any potential referrals for him.  I said we also have a rev share / affiliate program for any clients he sends our way.  

3.  Dev.Ai - He has an Agenic Ai platform (who doesn't) that he'll send our way as well.  I told them we already do that but it'll be cool to see what they have going on for recon purposes.  


We didn't talk about Peoria Commerce at all which is strange.  Maybe he had a different CPA partner for that one or maybe he's just waiting to see what the rev share would be.  

I think I mocked up a rev share agreement when we were talking to Amir and think I said we should start building out an Affiliate program at that point so here's our chance.",https://app2.karbonhq.com/4mTyp9lLRWTC#/work/3J8PkC6wfLbz,,,N/A - Business Dev channel,0,MA_MALLOUK_JOHN_2235

Quick scouting report from John is that he's very well connected in AZ.  The text message said he was working with the Peoria Chamber of Commerce on helping them set up their 501c6 which is basically a Non-Profit that is designated for things like Sports Clubs or Business Groups like this.  

I did ALFRED / AnyQuest research, created the Karbon Contact for the PCoC as well as the work item.  

Austin said in his text that they don't have much of a budget but I think this would help us build some goodwill with the organization which might lead to business clients in the Arizona area.  Luckily we already have boots on the ground out there.

He had reached out around April cause he's looking for a change and has wanted to get more into the Accounting / Finance world.  

I used to work with Eben at Outseer (same company as P24) where Eben was in charge of revenue and billing.  Essentially, his job was to track all the deals that the sales people close and set it up within the accounting system (i.e. Once the proposal is signed than building out the revenue schedule in the system) as well as billing for consulting projects.  

Eben indirectly reported to me so didn't work with him day to day but when I did work with him, he was super diligent.  We had a giant pile of poop from Dell and Eben combed through all the details to ensure the new company was set up.  I think he'd do well in the proposals/billing role here if the position were to become available.

...we talked for all 1.5 hours... 

I think I provided background on the first debrief but basically he is currently managing the leases for the commercial properties that his dad already established and he is, as he would say, and aspiring commercial real estate developer.  He was working on some 150 acre project that he wants to build a medical hub and talking to non profits (Shriners, Make a Wish, etc.) who might want to invest and or rent.  He needs to find $77m in order to fund this project.  

He also says he has a couple side projects such as a Denny's that is already rented out with a 20 year lease and another project of the type in the $1m range.  He says if we knows anyone that will want to invest, he pays a 1.0 - 1.5% referral fee.  

From a Tax standpoint, he uses the CPA his father uses for their business and says the guy is elite at the beginning of the call.  After I gave him the Motta rundown and ALFRED Ai, he said that he is looking to branch off on his own eventually and that the CPA is like 65 and he's 25 so he'll need to find a new accountant eventually so think he'll be a longer term prospect while being a referral channel in between.   

He also has a brother who is a lawyer but doesn't seem like they are similar really.  From what I gather, his brother is part of the LBGTQIA+ community which Harrison has no issues with, but his brother in general makes it about his sexual preferences and seems like a narcissistic person in general.  He says his brother is more left and he leans more right politically but more about his brother as a person than it is any of that stuff.  

Either way, I guess he's my ""friend"" here and hopefully a referral channel but he seems like a Trust Fund Baby and on the list of people asking me to hang out with them when I just want to stay at home and hang out with Brody.

We explained the breakdown that he'll have a schedule E with his portion of the income and his mom will have the same thing on her non-resident return with her portion. We discussed some math options on how we can possibly move some of the income to his mom since she'll get an income exclusion since she's foreign but we'll need to see how things shake out.

He told us that him and Molly are looking to add more properties to their portfolio in the future (2026/2027) and they'll want to go the LLC and trust route (opposite of what his mom wanted for their shared property). We discussed how that will look for them as well and he will reach out to us once those things start to come to fruition so that we can re-group and do it all properly.

He also gave us some background on him and Molly and their finances - basically they have a large amount of consumer debt/debt in general that they're trying to pay down and he said they're throwing everything they have to pay that off currently. He said on paper it looks like they're doing great (400k in combined w-2) but always feels like they have nothing left and just getting by. Molly also hates her job, so he said once they get some more debt paid off in 1-2 years she's going to be stepping away from it and will probably take a 150k pay cut. he said he did the math and it maths, but he was obviously stressed and just trying to get everything in order so that they can afford to do that and set themselves up well for the future.

She rescheduled the call from earlier today and then told us she might be being induced in 30 minutes but still wanted to talk through this.

She wanted to know how to avoid tax penalties at year end and discuss payroll. She said her financial advisor ""who makes a lot of money"" only pays himself a $55K salary so she wants to do the same because she doesn't really want to do the salary but wants the tax savings (she also doesn't really understand that her not having a salary but having an active s-corp is tax evasion but alas). So we need to help her set up Gusto for payroll and she'll probably only pay herself 50-60k. She also wants to do quarterly estimates, we explained the difference between doing it based on prior year vs on actuals, we'll send her two quotes so she can pick which option she wants to go with. She said her business income will be in line with prior year ($407K) so we can use that for estimates. Note the 407K makes the 55K salary really not make much sense but she's difficult so we can hopefully get that better aligned over time because she didn't like to hear 60/40 (but her current set up also isnt legal).

NOTE: she wants her husband to be cc'd on all of the emails for these items since she might have the baby today/coming soon regardless.

Action items:

- Brian to make three proposals:
1. Gusto onboarding
2. tax estimates (simple, safe harbor estimates - $250/quarter? defer to dat)

He forwarded us all the registrations docs so I added them to the work timeline.  One thing was that he opened it as an LLC but think it'll be an SCorp by the end of 2025.  

He said he was about to sign some Mega deal but some guy who's looking to invest had to go to London to meet with the company who ""invented insurance"" then going into the July 4th weekend so his grand plan for zillions of dollars is on hold until he can talk to that guy.  

We parlayed the conversation into talking about our services and said that Sharon (APL is the consulting firm name) had sent Mitch an email with all the reports and stuff she needs cleans up before she can make CFO recommendations.  Mitch and the person who recommended the firm recognizes that they've paid $19k to them and she's done nothing.   

I directly said to Mitch that if he paid us $19k than we would have been able to do it easily.. we just can't allocate time towards 3PM at $300 per month especially when Andrew already does weekly meetings with them.  

We came to the agreement that they'll get rid of Sharon and increase our contract to a CFO services account somewhere between the $300 they're paying now and the $5k per month they are paying Sharon.  I'd be down for the $5k per month but also that would increase our workload with 3PM significantly.   

One thing to note is that Mitch doesn't need monthly meetings with all the branches but just monthly reports to go out to them on a monthly basis.  Also nothing that 3PM will be switching to accrual method so the A-Team (accounting team) can build this client out as a CFO client.  

I saw 2 separate repeating work items for their Monthly Accounting and a lot of stale work items in general so Matty/Andrew to sync up and level set with all things 3PM as we're moving towards a CFO relationship anyways.

Nicole wanted to see the breakout of advertising and software subscriptions so they can see what they are spending and to see how they can cut costs and see what subscriptions they are paying on a monthly basis which was setup before the meeting which she liked. Overall, meeting went well. Just need to review the simpilfile costs since they pay this up front and then the client reimburses them back a for little more but it might be pennies so we will need to figure out how to reallocate this. Provided her with some insights and ways to possibly balance transfers and moving to the AMEX plum card (60 days to defer interest, 1.5% unlimited cash back if you pays 10 days after closing, and no preset limits).

As we were talking, they seem to have AP issues and managing this along with their cash on hand. I told them I had experience in this area and provided the potential scope of work and they were extremely interested. The service would provide them complete AP management which includes monitoring all of their payables, scheduling 2 meeting a month on top of the monthly meeting which will include a customized excel spreadsheet of their total cash on hand balance, all of their payables and go over which payables they want to pay and how much and then the excel will calculate what their ending balance is. Ann is going to work on adding in all of the outstanding payables into QB for managing and tracking purposes. If we can manage their AP which I see no issues with, I think this is help them in the long run as they wait for their collections.

Nick and Mark discussed Medford Boat Club.  He told this crazy story about how a member was trying to sue the club because a bench fell over and he said it landed on him but it didnt. So he has been dealing with that mess and the guy sueing the club had actually spent time with him at his cape house but lawyers said he is not allowed at the house anymore and he doesnt want him there anyway as they found out he hasnt work for 25yrs and just sues people as his job it seems like. Anyway, Nick again apologized and said he would be in touch about the bookkeeping. 

SEED: went over high level items, they need to finalize companies but looking to work with 8 companies overall but not all companies would work with each clinic. SEED itself is going to be assigned a team of students and be a client of the clinic. Nicks hope is it will help reel in Chaim and Boris from bouncing around from one big idea to the next.  

Nick, said everybody needs to have the same syallabus and everybody needs to partner for midterms- not sure how Ken will handle this...

Classes for the first 5 weeks with be set up in 45mins all hands, 45mins (AI, Lawyer Clinic, guest speakers), and 45mins clinic specific time. The Lawyer Clinic will also be present a few times during the semester for office hours during class time, when teams can pop in and ask questions. 

Will is working on developing a 4 part vidoe series that will highlight was SEED does. Nick and Will are going to discuss SEED outreach ideas and get back to the group.

Talked to Mark Comerio who is the head of the Woburn Chamber of Commerce, Ive become good friends with. He runs a remediation firm with him and his wife. Love of mutual connections he is good friends with TQ, Jmac's step dad. 

David Cockreham- Principal Partner at DB2 Architecture.  He recently bought out the original founding partner, so he is stil trying to figure out the finances of running a business. He has one other Partner but the other guy is client facing focused on business building, I met him as well, I believe it was Steve, did get his business card. David is doing the categoriztion of the bookkeeping and than they are doing monthly meeting with an accounting firm out of beverly. He said they are ok but not married to them.  He wsa upset that last year, they only had him do estimate in Q1 and Q2 and told him he didnt need them for Q3 or Q4 but than he had 10k tax bill that he wasnt happy about, would of rather just paid the estimates. I got along really well with David, he is kind of a shy guy, so I started talking to him when he was standing by himself. I think he will be a client of ours in the future. 

Matthew Troisi is younger, started a bookkeeping business, he was nice, I explained our business and how we have worked with Financial Advisors, and happy to just play in the tax space and be a resource for his clients. He was very open to it, his clients are always asking for a CPA referral but hasnt found a CPA he works well with.  Only been in business about 1yr not sure how many clients he has yet.  Could be a potential Motta Contractor or buy up his business in the future. For now, a center of influence for tax and wealth management referrals. 

Gerry McCarthy -owns Mac's Landscape Contacting.  Super nice guy, older gentlemen.  He has the landscaping business that seems to do ok but he also has a big real estate portfolio, he owns the land the dunkin donut in stoneham on franklin st is on, he leases the land to the franchise owner, said that a really nice paycheck and mentioned he owns other properties. He most likely has a finance team in place but a good guy to build a relationship with. 

Leah Hancock - Founder of Placid Marketing- super nice lady, was there with her husband who is a Wakefield firefighter. Both great people, 4 years older than Mark, they both went to Wakefield. Her husband new Matt Chambers who is a Wakefield Police Officer, that I am friends with. She is still early in the launch of her marketing business, will do website build outs and general marketing consulting on social media and the overall business. She said the biggest mistake she sees is people overspending on social media ads, made me think of Monteforte. Talk a little bit about the struggles of running a business and a little shop on accounting and financial planning. They liked the idea of having everything under one roof, thye have a CPA and Financial Planner but they siad they not always on the same page.  I recommended they set up quarterly or bi-annual meetings with their team of advisors and they loved that idea. No action items but good people added to the pipeline. 

Warren Fuller- Works for USA Demolition on Winn Street in Woburn, he was there with the owner Mike Winn. Warren, recently retired from the VA and I think Mike and him are good friends so he just started working for Mike in retirement to stay busy. They mainly do large scale commercial demolition but will do residential 10% of their business. They just joined the Chamber and are doing ribbon cutting next week at their office. They have been in business for 41yrs.Warren asked about TSP plans, they are the retirement plans for federal employees. I was familiar with them because Kylee has one from when she worked at the VA, its basically the same as 401k.",https://app2.karbonhq.com/4mTyp9lLRWTC#/work/3JSfNL8tbxfx?emailId=2gBlbtrR4hFz,,,n/a,0,

He basically just wanted to know next steps and he's overwhelmed with the audit and what's going on. I told him we're in the discovery stage so we're just trying to gather some documents and see what NV is saying to him and what he's been sending so that we can get the lay of the land. He's going to send us some preliminary documents just so that we can start to get a feel for things while he waits on them to send their 'findings'. He thinks a lot of this is from out of state sales (meaning, someone comes in and buys a car and lives in AZ then takes it home to AZ and they need to pay the AZ sales tax) which he says they're doing by the books and the have the registrations for everything but NV wants some super specific document and its going in circles. He was on the same page as me in terms of we'll just review the docs and get the lay of the land while he waits for the findings - he didnt want us going down rabbit holes/doing extra work until we get that doc which i appreciated.   

He's going out of town for the next few weeks on saturday so he's going to try to get me everything before then - we left it as i'll review everything in the meantime to get a feel for whats going on and the scope of the work.

super nice/cool guy and very easy to talk to & he already loves us after his first convo with dat (he spoke super highly of that convo & likes that were just real & normal people) so this will probably lead to a lot more work items down the road. he asked about bookkeeping (monthly reconciliations etc.) and i explained that we're a full service firm so we can definitely help him with that if he wants it - i told him that we would reach out with some bookkeeping resources/motta info so that he can just see what we offer for the time being and get a feel for the firm which he seemed really excited about.

This was a ""Consult"" for a potential investment property but he said he's definitely going to use use for taxes at year end.  

Tyler is a childhood friend of Cary.  He got his MBA at NYU and is currently a big dick Management Consultant at E&Y Parthenon (Big 4 firm but their consulting arm) so we've commiserated about Big 4 life.  He says he's probably making close to $300k in 2025 so think he'll be a tax planning / wealth management prospect for sure.  

Tucker is his younger brother (not sure how much younger) but also knows Cary well.  He just started in the Real Estate world so he makes no money but essentially the ""Brains"" behind his real estate investment with Tyler mostly being the funder.  All this stuff is a very new world for Tyler so a lot of the meeting (for the both of them) was talking through tax concepts (Active vs Cap Gains vs Passive Income).

Tyler scheduled the meeting so I don't have a recording but they are looking to buy a Duplex under an FHA loan which will be a lower interest rate (although it's only 0.5% lower than commercial which gives you the state of the RE market) which means they can't transfer it to an LLC and they have to live in it for a year.   Luckily it's a duplex.  

We talked through a bunch of scenarios but Tucker is going to live in and manage the two units and the other unit is already being rented out.  Think the most efficient strategy is for Tyler/Tucker to buy the house together (and probably just Tyler is on the mortgage) and then Tyler than Lease the property to the LLC for the other side of the duplex.  This will help Tucker qualify for RE Professional status and for Tyler to be able to take 50% of the interest as an itemized deduction.

The issue is that from a ""Company Optics"" perspective, he's getting pressure to move to California so he's looking to get an apartment in Sacramento to appease them.  The company is a Non Profit called ""Visit California"" which is essentially The State of California's subsidiary for tourism.  Sort of tough message to send to not live in the state... 

He is currently supporting his gf and her daughter so they are amendable to him going back and forth.  They said they would cover flights for the first 6 months but expect him to have a primary residence in California within the year.  

We talked through the approach of getting an apartment in California and still getting wages there but if his payroll department can set up Nevada as a work location for him since he'll be working a decent amount of hours in Nevada and it would help him on state taxes.  This is similar to the New York clients we see where they have W2 wages in New York and New Jersey.  I think if he makes sure to allocate his wages and spends more than 181 days in Nevada (which he will), the state tax implications will be minimal.   Call this strategy ""Sac Town Trap House"". 

I put together a quick estimator for him but we don't have his wages and he was having trouble accessing all of that but said he made $155k base there and his weekly paycheck was like $1700.  

His income will go up significantly this year, he's the director of IT and building out an IT team.  He currently only has 2 help desk people and only 1 of them is good.  I said he was like James Harden and he agreed.  He said he needs a CP3 and I said that it still didn't work and he responded ""At least it's the furthest he went"" 

He'll get that all set up but also said when the travel expenses do dry up he was looking to run the travel expenses through an LLC he has set up.  When he was looking for jobs he was doing independent work.  Although Sean Day is among my favorite people in the world.  He has a new born in the world and think that takes priority in his life (which it should) so TJ said he'd be willing to do some independent IT work for us.  This might work out because TJ lives up the street.  

He said he'd send us his 2024 tax return (we only asked for 2023 and 2022..) and said he'd take care of the payroll stuff but definitely wants to start using us for taxes / planning since his income just went up significantly.  He said he wanted to get his finances in order in general so I think this will be a financial planning prospect generated by taxes... plus an IT resource.

Zoom Meeting summary for Thomas Johnson and Dat Le (06/20/2025)

Quick recap
The meeting focused on tjohnson's financial situation, particularly regarding tax withholding issues related to his work location and potential strategies to minimize tax liability. Discussions also covered tjohnson's challenges with his IT department, including staffing needs and team management concerns. Additionally, the conversation touched on tjohnson's new job, financial planning, and the possibility of starting a consulting business to optimize tax benefits.

Next steps
tjohnson to contact HR about adding Nevada as a workplace location to potentially reduce California state tax withholdings.
tjohnson to obtain and provide Dat with income and tax withholding information from his previous job for the first part of the year.
Dat to update tax projections with the additional income information and send the Excel sheet to tjohnson.
tjohnson to explore options for leveraging his LLC (Thomas Johnson Consulting) to write off travel expenses.
tjohnson to consider maxing out his 401(k) contributions once eligible (after 6 months of employment) to lower taxable income.
tjohnson to investigate obtaining a California address (e.g., studio apartment) for work purposes while maintaining Nevada residency.
Summary
Tax Withholding and 401(k) Discussion
Dat and tjohnson discussed tjohnson's financial situation, particularly regarding tax withholding issues due to his work location being incorrectly set as California. Dat explained the complications with payroll companies and suggested two options: getting the withholding corrected now or claiming a credit on taxes at year-end, though some deductions might not be available immediately. They also briefly touched on tjohnson's new job, which is a tourism nonprofit, and his eligibility to contribute to a 401(k) after six months of employment.

IT Team Leadership Challenges
Tjohnson discussed challenges with his IT department, noting that while some help desk staff are competent, communication can be difficult. He mentioned having openings for two roles, a systems engineer and a solutions architect, but expressed concern that the data team was trying to take the solutions architect position. Tjohnson emphasized the need for someone to manage his small team, comparing his situation to running a basketball offense like James Harden, and suggested he needed a ""Chris Paul"" to help balance the team.

Tax Planning and Financial Review
Dat and tjohnson discussed tjohnson's tax situation and financial planning. They reviewed tjohnson's current pay stubs and discussed projecting his tax withholding and deductions for the year. Dat suggested tjohnson consider changing his work location to Nevada to potentially reduce state income taxes. They agreed to gather more information about tjohnson's previous income and deductions to make more accurate projections. Dat also mentioned the need to determine appropriate 401(k) contributions and withholding levels once they have all the necessary data.

Tax Strategies for Remote Work
Tjohnson discussed his situation with Dat regarding his work location and tax implications. He explained that his company prefers him to move to California, but he plans to maintain his Nevada residency by getting a studio apartment near the office. Dat suggested talking to HR about adding Nevada as a workplace and advised on tax strategies to minimize California tax liability. They also discussed the possibility of tjohnson starting a consulting business to write off travel expenses.",https://app2.karbonhq.com/4mTyp9lLRWTC#/work/4pDpLprXFSQV,,,"I said I'd just toss all this ""Planning"" into his tax prep fee but I'd like to show him the Gross Prices so he has a reference point for potential IT services.  

I would say do Tax Prep, 1040 Schedule C (Thomas Johnson LLC),  MottaGuard Compliance, and a Comprehensive Review & Assessment.

Do it all under tax prep and do it for $100 deposit and the remaining $150 upon completion of the tax return.  If we want to do the $100 for the review now just so we don't have open Proposals if/when we switch to Karbon Engagements than do that but get it to $250 all together.

"Jun 20, 2025",Prospect/Client,,,,,,,,,,,Work Item Has Been Created,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,CO_GAVAN_JASON_0000,,Dat Le,"Talked to Jason/Vamsi who were super appreciative with Motta for all of our help and patience when scrambling to get their taxes done last year.  We talked through a lot of the issues and compliance type considerations we found during the process.  

It was a great conversation and they understood they had some messiness on their end.  It was also evident that this is not their world (Vamsi is a doctor so not surprising) and they got some bad advice.  Vamsi said her attorney said she can get an app that she can set up and she would not have to do any work.  When I asked her which part of the job the app would do, she wasn't sure.  Also talked through Salary vs Distributions for Upiri.  

Jason didn't talk a ton, it seems he's super on board but Vamsi is more technical in making sure they understand what they are paying for.  I think Jason has a lot of super successful friends and also wants to be able to say he's got a CPA when talking to them.  

We spent a decent amount of time on the pricing which was expected since it was a ""Here's all we do, what would you like to do?"" and we've learned more about them since that point.  I was accidentally working off a wrong version and it had an excel error in there.  I hate myself for this.  

I updated the model with the services and explanations.  Sent them the updates with detailed explanations.  

Overall they'll do something (Tax Prep at least) and it was a great conversation.  Vamsi comes off way more harsh in emails, which I think she mentioned during the call but I'm not sure if she was talking about me, and think they like us a lot.  Jason appreciates that we're so responsive and Vamsi even shared the origins of her SCorp name.  

One outstanding item is that they wanted to basically simulate if they did tax planning with us in 2024, how much they would have saved.  Action item is for Caroline (or designee) to draft their 2023 return based on what they filed (Link here: https://ito.intuit.com/app/protax/tax-return?clientId=9341454074902086&engagementId=3bf0e3f7-44a0-4a96-a623-854b8b8952bf) because we need it in order to do the Intuit Tax Advisor plan for 2024.  

I think we'll be able to throw a handful of recommendations in there that would have covered our planning fees.  One key thing is that the ROI they are trying to calculate is the ""Planning & Advisory"" so when presenting it to them, it's only those fees because the others they would have to do anyways (i.e. tax prep)

The meeting focused on tax filing deadlines and issues. Jason reported receiving an IRS notice for their 2023 filing and is having trouble contacting their previous firm. Caroline clarified that the hedgehog LLC, being a partnership, must file by March 15th, unlike personal returns due April 15th. The group discussed the different deadlines for various tax entities, with pass-through entities like partnerships and S-corps due a month earlier than personal returns. Jason agreed to try contacting the IRS or previous firm one more week before seeking further assistance.

Tax Planning and Service Review
The team discussed their tax preparation experience, with Jason and Vamsi expressing satisfaction with the responsiveness and efficiency of the team despite some initial errors. They agreed that next year's process should be smoother. The conversation then shifted to tax planning, where Jason raised concerns about the high costs of quarterly tax planning services. Dat explained that accounting fees are generally deductible and emphasized the importance of analyzing whether the savings would exceed the costs. They agreed to review the pricing details and discuss which services would be most beneficial for the client.

CPA and CHCFT Service Structure
The team discussed the structure and approach to providing CPA and CHCFT services, emphasizing a personalized and comprehensive suite of services tailored to each client's unique needs. Dat explained their method of categorizing income types and conducting tax planning, while also addressing bookkeeping, payroll, and ongoing accounting needs. The group reviewed a cost structure document, which Dat agreed to share with the team, and discussed the potential for deductibility of fees.

Financial and Tax Services Overview
Dat discussed financial and tax services, including monthly or quarterly bookkeeping, payroll, and account reconciliations. He mentioned consolidating financials on an entity and consolidated basis, handling quarterly payroll filing fees, and providing tax planning with quarterly estimates. Dat also talked about strategies to optimize tax savings, such as increasing 401(k) contributions, cost segregation studies for real estate, and exploring donor-advised funds and residential energy credits. He emphasized the importance of analyzing the cost and benefits of tax-saving strategies and mentioned that Caroline would handle most IRS communications.

Pricing and Service Bundle Review
The meeting focused on reviewing pricing and service bundles, where Dat explained that the provided pricing was not final but rather a high-level overview of potential costs for comprehensive services including tax preparation, bookkeeping, payroll, and planning. Vamsi asked questions about base fees versus adjustments, clarifying that adjustments account for bundling discounts and the ease of planning when all numbers are already available. The discussion confirmed that the quarterly estimates and planning fee of $4,000 was annual, and Vamsi acknowledged his initial misunderstanding about the cumulative nature of certain charges.

Bookkeeping vs. Financial Planning Services
Dat explained the difference between bookkeeping and quarterly estimates and planning services. He clarified that while bookkeeping involves daily transactions and compliance, quarterly estimates and planning provide a consolidated financial overview and forecasting for both business and personal finances. Vamsi asked about potential duplication with their financial consultant, Ross, and Dat confirmed that while there might be some overlap, their services would complement each other, with Dat's team collaborating with Ross on tax and financial planning considerations.

S Corp Payroll Planning Discussion
Vamsi discussed setting up and managing an S Corp, particularly regarding bookkeeping and payroll for 2024 and 2025. Caroline explained that while Vamsi could get away with informal quarterly payments in 2024 as it was their first year, proper payroll withholdings would be necessary for 2025 to comply with IRS requirements. Dat clarified that using a payroll system would help avoid self-employment taxes by treating the income as W-2 wages rather than business distributions, and Vamsi agreed to implement proper payroll processing starting next year.

Financial Planning and Alfred Platform
The meeting focused on discussing financial and tax planning services, including the use of a new platform called Alfred for efficient data management and strategic planning. Dat explained their pricing structure, emphasizing competitive rates and the potential for cost savings through their streamlined processes. Vamsi requested a detailed analysis of potential savings based on previous data, which Dat agreed to provide. The group also discussed the benefits of using Alfred, a beta platform designed to offer personalized tax advice and reduce administrative work. Dat promised to send a revised Excel sheet with high-level estimates and examples of potential savings, and Vamsi agreed to review this information within a week to make a decision.

Ubery's Ubuntu-Inspired Growth Strategy
The team discussed the firm's name ""Ubery"" and its meaning, which Dat explained was derived from Ubuntu principles of community and resource efficiency. Dat shared that Andrew, despite being busy with work, had requested more tasks since joining the firm. The team reviewed some financial numbers, noting an intentional error that had been made to demonstrate the impact of mistakes on the bottom line. Jason thanked the team for their thorough front-loading of discussions, which helped with decision-making.",https://app2.karbonhq.com/4mTyp9lLRWTC#/work/2Bph4QyxXN4d,,,"See pricing sheet link:

Pretty interesting meeting for 15 minutes and got some good info out of it. 

First - They said they have a bunch of stuff rolling out that is confidential and won't be announced until Intuit Connect (which is probably their annual conference) that they are coming out with a QuickBooks on steroids called ""Supernova"" which is supposed to be built for the ""Enterprise"" type clients which might serve a lot of companies that might not be at NetSuite level.  Their Enterprise version right now is only on desktop I believe.   

Steve said their API wasn't ready yet because it was only built to speak internally. The issue with that is that it can't tell which Intuit profile (QBO, ProConnect, etc.) because the database is so massive and the API can't be limited to just a certain amount of data.  

He said they tried to work with Darkhorse CPAs (which is a good competitor to us) and they tried to test the API with ProConnect.  From what I gather from Steve, I think that set both sides back a lot.  He says the API can pull information out of ProConnect (but still doesn't work great) and they are still figuring out how to get information into ProConnect.  

Steve said they just got funding and the status is that the executives are fighting over where to spend the new investment.  This makes me think they might be a white label of Intuit but every ""Start Uppy"".  He says once they get the dollars allocated towards getting the resources they'll be able to distribute the API.  He projected a year but hopefully they'll give us the inside scoop on that.  My fear is that with the Darkhorse experiment gone poorly, Management will be hesitant to do that again.  

One thing that came into my head was that Darkhorse probably had shit data which added delays to an already massive project.  Once it got too expensive for both sides, they cut bait.  Emphasizing to the team how important it is to get the data clean in the first time so it makes us more versatile / dynamic on the back end.  

David and the Tekyz team was on the call which I appreciated because I know it's late there but I think it was good for them to hear the status of the ProConnect API and the potential avenues there.  David was good at getting a soft commitment that they would work with us on the call.   

We'll stay in touch with ProConnect but obviously it will be a Game Changer if we can get them to talk.",https://app2.karbonhq.com/4mTyp9lLRWTC#/work/2L79NZYw4CkP,,,0,0,TX_WHEELIS_STEVEN_0000

We needed to talk through Brittany Scott with him since she contributed too much into her ROTH IRA.  

All in all, think there was some missteps with her old Financial Planner (Harrison inherited this client) and her accountant who didn't catch that she overfunded it.  

Harrison said he'd introduce us to the investment team so that we can handle it without him being a bottleneck but we actually will need an amendment for 2024 to change the ROTH IRA contribution amount to the proper amount.  He said they won't be able to do anything with the account until they get that amended return.  

I know we talked about refunding her but turns out we do need it so let's get that going and change the contribution amounts for the conversion.  

Once the investment team sells off whatever they need to, she is going to have a taxable gain/loss on her investment for 2025 so note that for year end.",https://app2.karbonhq.com/4mTyp9lLRWTC#/work/3dMHkDjnfzf4,,,Hopefully we haven't already refunded her but we'll need to get the amendment done before she can make the correcting distribution.,0,CO_HUNTER_HARRISON_2793

Cleared up outstanding items for 2024 Bookkeeping to wrap up his taxes.  Went over partner distributions and loans on the balance sheet, and over the counter deposits. He has a business savings acct, that we were not fully aware, so he is going to send over bank statements for that acct. Mostly just monthly banks fees, they made him open up the savings acct, when he opened the business checking.  

For 2023 Amended he received a notice, saying that there wasn't enough information provided and that we need to fill out 2023 tax form. He texted me the notice, I will upload to Karbon.

He is having a hat drop, he thinks next Saturday. So might to stop by if they do the drop. 

Al asked about our thoughts on him selling a piece of the company in an equity deal.  He has pitch for the BXC investors, next week. So he seemed nervous about that, not really nervous about the pitch but what to do if he gets an offer. Walked him through some high level thoughts on equity vs debt deals, he was appreciative and good to see he sees us as a trusted advisor to his business.

Most of it was rambling for the most part but we talked CannaLean as well. 

We both agreed we'll get the accounting caught up for now and then we'll talk potential equity type arrangements.  I think we talked about it as a team but without the numbers and stuff, even if we did take a %, we'd be shooting blind.  

With that said, I said we'd do the Accounting Set Up and Catch Up and then assess from there.  So this will be just a bookkeeping onboarding job and a business valuation job.

Josh is a bartender and makes 100-110K/year but 2/3 of the income is tip income. His employer only withholds on his salary portion (typical scenario) so they're going to be underwithheld for 2025 unless they make estimates or increase their withholding. We suggested estimates since they can pay those in during times where his income is higher (its a sports bar so ex. fall when football starts). 

Camille had questions on whether or not it would make sense for them to file seperately instead of MFJ so that her student loan payments don't go up drastically. Mark mentioned that loophole might be going away, so it probably wont make sense for them but I am going to do some research and send her our findings.

They are definitely prospects/leads for tax estimates and financial planning. Brian - can you put this on RP so we have it for tracking purposes and don't forget? Nothing to do now for them for those items, but it will most likely transition into that in the future. She was a referral from Becca Jacobson so we don't have FA ties here.

To do's:
- Brian to add them as leads for estimates + financial planning
- Caroline to send Camille instructions on how to submit estimated payments and summary of what we discussed (timing etc.).

He said no rush on the Co-Operative front but one thing he just discovered was that he was basically taking a 50% haircut on revenue from all that insurance stuff as well as just giving out free services cause he feels bad in general.  

He said the first Medical Billers he had did such a terrible job that they almost got audited and would have lost out on all the Reimbursements from a particular insurance company.  He said they just hired another company that seems like a family owned business.  He said they were a little more expensive but hopefully the quality is much better.  The end goal is to hire an internal one but they aren't quite there yet. 

From our standpoint, I asked how he was getting the insurance info because I'd like to see what Gross vs Net billings are because in the HealthCare industry, there's a ""COGs"" component because if they bill something for $100, insurance will reimburse $80 or something like that.  I think right now we just see the $80 hit the bank account but obviously the Gross vs Net would be super insightful for them.

"Jun 14, 2025",Prospect/Client,,,,,,,,,,,Work Item Has Been Created,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1040: Individual Return,,,,,,,,,,Dat Le,"Ryan from the VYP Fusion Mixer hit me up on Friday to go out for a drink.  We went to the Durango resort as a middle point between us (He's currently in Green Valley Ranch which is a very nice area of Henderson) but he wants to be closer to the strip. 

Ryan is from New Jersey originally but then moved to New York to work where he for a Hedgefund in Finance which he did for almost 10 years.  He said he used to be a ""No Mouse"" excel guy which made me a fan immediately although he admits his excel skills are weak since leaving Finance.  He moved to Chicago for a girl and then she convinced him to move to Las Vegas because that's where her family is from but that relationship ended poorly.  He's now a Vegas local though so overall still a win! 

He got sick of the Corporate America world and wanted to do something he loved.  He was always into Boxing and got REALLY into it after the movie, The Fighter.  

He worked hard to get into the industry/networks and ended up landing a Sponsorship deal for a friend of his for Teofimo Lopez. After that, his friend hired him to essentially be the Manager for about 50 professional boxers.  

He said it was good for a few years but since COVID, the boxing sport has been tough.  He said for the last Canelo fight, no one he knew was able to secure Sponsorships for the fighters or the event.  

The industry is also similar to the UFC industry how it's the wild west in the Athlete infrastructure space.  He was put between screwing over his boss or screwing over Teofimo and ended up just leaving the industry.  

He now works at a boxing equipment company but he hates it and wants to start getting back into the industry.  He's been making calls to his network and trying to get back in with a Fighter or Management company. 

He seems like he as a giant network with some famous people.  Including some of the instagrams below but he says he's friends with Adam Weitsman who is a billionaire from New York based on a Google Search.  He says they text regularly and that guy is involved with Jake Paul and Ryan is trying to network his way onto the boxing industry that way since Jake Paul is the only person in the sport who generates any money.  

He's around my age and actually moved to Vegas around the same time I did. He met a guy named Chris from Miami through Boxing and Chris was friends with Kenny.  I actually think I met him the same night I might Kenny at the J Cole concert but don't remember him.  

He'll be a LOMAR indy Prospect but think he'll be a good personal friend and also could be a good channel for referrals through his network.

I talked to him a little bit about what we do over the holidays and he had asked Cary ""Do you do your own taxes"" and Cary laughed and said ""Nah, Dat handles all that"" and he said ""Must be nice!"" so think he'll be a Motta client in 2025 if not he will be once his life gets more complicated.

He's also the most different of the three.  Cary/Julian are pretty similar but Cole the quiet type but absolute computer brain.  Cary/Julian went to Palisades High but Cole went to Harvard Westlake.  If you Google that school, it's one of the best Private Schools for education and sports in Southern California (maybe America?).  He then went to UPenn for college where he played some form of tackle football that wasn't real football.  I'm a lot closer to Cary and Julian (who interned at REDACTED) but I always say Cole is my favorite of the Jacobson brothers because he's a Red Sox fan.  He's also a Sixers/Eagles fan so it might cancel each other out but at least he's a Sox fan.  

Cole's about 28 and has been trying to get into sports analytics for a LONG time.  He coaches football at Harvard Westlake and also does Contract work during the baseball season where he has had published articles on Advanced Analytics.  He also has written a bunch of studies and articles on Advanced Analytics in Football and actually has been to the NFL combine a couple of times to present his study to NFL scouts.  He went last year and came in 3rd place I think.  

I learned via Snapchat that he just got a job with the Buffalo Bills.

Amir wants to start bookkeeping Oct 1st because that is when his new firm will launch. Bill for June-Sept in October and Andrew would need to get the company caught up on Bookkeeping. 

Ola Mate is a new set up, with multiple integrations to figure out.  SOS Inventory, Amazon, TicToc, shopify. Various different ecommerce platforms. Want to pay for A2X to help with shopfy integration. Not familiar with that but suppose to make things easier, so we need to do some research on that front. 

AJ, was on board for Ola Mate since its new set up with no current bookkeeper. AJ had reservations about leaving current bookkeeper for Scordio. 

Amir and AJ are firends and they had pretty Firey conversation on this point that Andrew and Mark sat back on. Amir, will swear a lot on calls, so know who you are talking with. 

AJ was pushing back a lot on getting charge an onboarding fee, since he alreadys has a bookkeeper whats to onboard was his point but there would be some clean up and reorganizing the chart or accts but we can be flexible with the price for onboarding for Scordio. 

Overall good first joint client call and was good to see how Amir handles client objections and pushes back on clients thoughts on pricing/ Althought i think the relationship dynamic was unique on this call between Amir and AJ.

He says it was really good when he first got into it but Boxing has fallen off in popularity since Mayweather, Pacman, and all of those boxers have retired.  He says he's hoping there's another Jake Paul card soon and that he rejuvenates the sport.  He doesn't directly work with Jake Paul but has worked with some boxers that are on the boxing cards he puts on.  

He says with the boxing market slowing down, he also works with an equipment company (not sure which one) on the other side of sponsorships to get boxers equipment and stuff like that.  

We briefly talked about how we work with fighters on the MMA side and how they need CPAs and he said it was the same on the boxing side.  Think this could be a decent channel into the Boxing athletes which I think is a decent sized market in Vegas.

She's not a US citizen and lives in Canada. She's an experienced Canadian accountant so she knows Canada rules really well but not US rules. She wants to buy a rental property in Myrtle Beach with Mitch (50/50 split) so she was wondering how she should go about doing that from a US tax perspective.

We walked through the benefits of an LLC with liability protection but because of the extra tax form/cost she didn't see the point of doing it. They're going to do the rentals through Airbnb/VRBO so she said they have enough coverage with insurance. Mark informed her that she should tell the real estate attorney to make sure to put the deed as tenants in common with rights to survivorship so that Mitch gets the property when she dies (what she wants). 

She also wanted to know what will happen from an estate perspective when she dies and passes the property on to mitch - Mark/Caroline to do some research here because its a grey area with the foreign aspect.

Without the LLC her and mitch will each report their 50% share on their individual 1040 sch E (instead of a partnership return). Brian - we already have a work item for her 2025 tax return, can you just make sure its on 2026 RP? We will also need a proposal but i think we should wait to send it until they actually buy the property. it will be a 1040 return + sch E, she was kind of shocked by the $500 flat fee Mark mentioned so maybe we add a discount since the books will be clean (i pray) and she'll only have a schedule E.

He apologized for being out of touch, he went to Japan & Thailand then rolled right into Spring Camp with the football team.  

He says from a business standpoint, they haven't made a ton of headway but has raised $100k + $5k from various sources.  The money should come in within the next couple of months.  

He says for 2025, this is essentially their FGA year so they only want to do 4-5 deals so learn/build the process on their end.  One of their partners just got their insurance title license so now they can be the title insurance broker on deals so seems like their still in the process of setting up their business infrastructure.

He says between the money that they've won along with capital contributions, they need to start to organize all of that as they launch which is typical Onboarding type stuff. 

He also says he needs a CPA Verification letter (that's notarized) stating that they have at least $10k in their bank account.  He says he'll deposit some cash in there to get over the $10k threshold but the letter is the gating item for them getting them additional financing.  

It's still too early for a Bookkeeping contract as they aren't operating yet but he wants to get the Accounting System / Payroll System set up.  I said we should keep it simple with QBO Ledger / Gusto for set up and he agreed.

He started by saying he's basically only getting paid for 50% of the work he's done since starting since Health Insurance registrations/approvals have been a nightmare and Ryan doesn't have the heart to turn away patients.  Having said that, the business is growing a bunch and they've had a couple of months in a row where they make enough to cover all their business expense and pay their personal bills.  This is awesome to see and they are forever appreciative of all of our help to get them to this point.  

Ryan then went through his idea of a business model where the employees own the company (He had mentioned this when he first started the company and it was a Co operative type thing).  He was going to start it with another lady but she was awful so they just went SCorp.  

I think he wants to re-engage that now that they are at a stable place (business wise).  Matt was involved in those conversations back in the day so I'll get him involved along with Caroline.  Maybe Dwyer over the top to further get his reps in the business advisory world.

It was a phone call and the meeting ended up being about an hour where we talked about typical backgrounds and then the state of CannaLean and where he wants to go with it.  Kenny is the ""Sales / BD"" side of the business, Chris is the Scientist, and Damion is on the business side.  We seem to share a lot of the same philosophies. 

He's a 20 year retired Air Force vet and then got his Masters / MBA and has a handful of ventures he has going on along with 11 rental properties.  We briefly talked through RE tax benefits.  Also talked through how we are hyper focused on efficiently and how we've set up our processes and that resonated as that is what he's trying to do with CL.  He has a tax person right now but there's a chance he'll come over if he ever gets sick of his tax people.  I think he was intrigued by what we had going on. I'm guessing he'll ask Kenny if we're legit and he'll explain to him that I'm MJ.  He's a lead for now.  

On the CannaLean side.. they basically have been operating for the same amount of time as Motta except Kenny was getting his doctorate so just doing this as a side hustle.  They've done no accounting and haven't really built the Business Infrastructure at all.  Kenny built a big Sales Infrastructure and Damion admitted that they probably spent the money to build an infrastructure to field growth but ran into operational issues which slowed them down so the money spent on that infrastructure was a bit pre mature / not efficient for a start up.  I said I could resonate with that and if anything, it's an FGA in ""Start Up Infrastructure"". 

Damion said he got involved to help with that and is a ""Green Belt"" in change mgmt.  He's essentially trying to set up the infrastructure because they've just been getting back knowing that money is coming in and money is going out.  Damion wants to actually build a plan to set them up to actually be scalable.  His goal is to get all the numbers cleaned up and build a plan / forecast to see how much inventory they need for 2026 so they can go to investors in the fall and say ""This is how much money we need so we can much this much inventory"".  

He said he wasn't sure why Kenny was saying we need a valuation because the numbers don't exist.  I explained that we're essentially getting caught up with the accounting to get the data first before we even get to the ""Valuation"" point.  He said he was skeptical but trusted Kenny so let him cook but now understands why we're here.  Damion thinks they are about 3-6 months away from that because the numbers from a sales perspective isn't strong by his standards.  They are making between $25k - $30k per month but with difficulties with inventory.  Kenny (and I guess Damion too) wants to expand into the CBD line (Which Damion said they got the design approval for?) but wants to make sure they get organized with everything they have going on first. 

I think this is mostly going to be an accounting / onboarding type engagement to start (they also agree they have no idea what the company is currently worth.   He said he's never been through the valuation before so curious the levers that factor into the overall valuation.  I said we can update valuations whenever so I'm sure we'll be working with them about it through the process. 

Damion said he'd get us the access we need for the sales reports and stuff but basically he's going to be helping on the Forecasting / Planning side and I said we'd be helping on the Accounting / Expense side.",https://app2.karbonhq.com/4mTyp9lLRWTC#/work/cVMTXqhkCSy,,,"I'm going to a networking event with Kenny on Thursday night so I'll talk to him about the proposal but I'm think we do the Accounting as a ""Try out"" for them to get a feel for us and for us to get more data on the company.

FRANK SHULMAN

I did not really intend to drink but one of Marcos' other friends, Frank Shulman, was there.  Frank is a VP with Lobos Tequila which I learned is LeBron's tequila.  Frank actually lives out in Gilbert AZ (told him we have a footprint there via OCP) but he's from Brooklyn NY originally.  He actually spent 8 months in Boston working for Legal Seafood.  He said he helped open the Airport Location as well as the one that's not the Seaport one although he helped open their test kitchen as well.  He was in Vegas for a brand activation at a Ne-Yo concert at Drai's.  He says he's in Vegas / LA all the time if the tequila is doing any kind of events.  He says a lot of their brand marketing is done through agencies so sometimes the agencies will screw them so if they are supposed to have a big activation, the agencies might forget about it or fumble it so he's always traveling to supervise these events.  We briefly talked about taxes but then did 2 consecutive shots of Lobos tequila and he had to leave.  

He gave me his card (I didn't have any on me) and I followed up via text.  I added the client contact into Karbon and the work item (folders synced.. you're welcome Brian) and added to Prospects (Not Likely) in 2026.  If he's back in town (or if I make a trip out to AZ) than we can consider him a prospect but think he's a lead for now.  

ALAN DURST

Alan is a Host at Zouk (nightclub) / Ayu (day club) and I've gotten to know him from going to Zouk so much with Cary.  When I'm not with Cary, there's usually a giant line of regular people to get into the club the regular way.  Then there's a crowd/line to check in if you get a table.  I usually politely ask those people to move out of the way and talk to Alan and he usually lets me and my friends in right away.  Also supplies us with wristbands to get on stage and some drink tickets obviously.  

While I was waiting in line, I thanked him for always getting into the club for free and said if he ever needed tax help than hit me up.  He said he definitely needs help and will hit us up at the end of the year.  I think we had sent him Knights tickets at some point but he's a Club Host so I'm not sure if he ended up just using it for work.  

Alan's a great dude in general.  He's from Ohio in general and big Ohio State guy.  Added him as a Prospect in RP 2026.  

MARCOS VALDEZ

Marcos works in Operations (?) at Zouk/Ayu.  When I first met him it was at the F1 race and he was the interim General Manager at Fuhu (EXECELLENT restaurant at Resorts World) when the GM & Assistant GM was poached by Komoto/Fountainbleau.  I'm still friends with those folks and also Marcos doesn't work at Fuhu anymore but I still see him all the time at Zouk.  He helps with Stage Bands when I don't get them from Allen and always supplies drink tickets if I'm not at a table.  

I learned that he's actually only 25 but the kid is a very kind soul and a very hard worker.  I had offered tax help last tax season but he never took me up on it.  Maybe this year but either way, think it's a prospect for 2025 taxes.",https://app2.karbonhq.com/4mTyp9lLRWTC#/work/VPXxfbpRc7q,,,All Leads/Prospects.

Clay just got back from Dubai where he is working his way into a company with a Crypto Platform that is supposed to have some fancy algorithm to beat the market.   We hadn't talked to him in a month because he was in Dubai and he said he's had like 100 meetings to get this going.

When I was a consultant at Steward Medical, I convinced him to move to Boston for that job and now he lives in my condo with his wife.  They also created a baby in that condo and he's now looking to purchase a percentage of it.  I was also in his wedding as an Usher.   

His dad has about $115k saved up for him with the intent of gifting it to him for a down payment on his home.  He wants to instead put it towards The Dat Cave.  He is talking to his Dad and we have to work out the rental payments going forward but think the Dat Cave might have to become a real client now that it's not just me.  

He asked about taxes on the $115k his dad gifts him but told him they can do the lifetime gift exclusion.  Also told him with all of this, I'd most likely have to do his taxes.  He was a TurboTaxer before.  

He said he also has another $60k he has liquid that he might put towards the Dat Cave which would be a 10/10 investment obviously but he just had a kid (James) so think it's time for some financial planning and seems like a candidate that would legitimately need life insurance now.  Part of the reason he's reaching out for the purchase of the D-Cave is because now that they have a kid, it doesn't make sense for Erin to go back to work since Child care costs are too high.  

He also has a bunch of money in a Fidelity account and asked to move it over whenever we're ready.  

His parents also have a Peanut farm (it used to be a cotton farm..) and he told me that they are currently upset with their current advisor because he sold them out of some of their company stock from employer plans to diversify and the company stock has gone way up.  I don't disagree with the diversification aspect of it but I don't think he was monitoring this too closely and don't think he's doing a good job. 

Weezy (Michael.. I nicknamed him Weezy because he's from Lou-Weezy-ana) told me his mom has $6m in retirement assets yet she hasn't retired yet and bitches / complains about her job.  I'm not sure what Michael's dad has for assets but they have a literal farm so me thinks they have a lot of old Southern money.

ScheLeese tried to stay on Honeybook to do everything but found it very inefficient and I would agree. 

We discussed on how to process invoices in QB, how to add product and services so she can use it on invoices which will automatically sync to the financial statements in categories, track the payment status to see where it is at in QB and when to expect it, how to add sales tax rates per city which will automatically save when she creates an invoice, payroll setup and the proper documents to get her payroll all set up for 6/13 or 6/16 since 15th is on a weekend.

ScheLeese mentioned the retainer amounts and Mark and Andrew discussed the difference between Cash vs Accrual. The money doesn't get book until the service is performed so in the meantime ScheLeese will track those as well and then we can compare once we finalize the excel spreadsheet. We are still in the works of the spreadsheet which P24 is working on and Andrew will be meeting with Matt to compare the spreadsheets and then start adding these into her QB file. This is more on the backend but for the most part I was highly impressed how detailed and how on top she is with all her accounts setup for payroll, etc. 

Mark and Andrew mentioned that how customizable we can make this for her as she starts growing since she is on the basic setup with chart of accounts and what items she would like to see and to create more buckets for operations (revenue and expenses). 

Action Items:
-Review sales tax rates and add them into the system
-Export product and services and provide this to ScheLeese to let us know what she wants changed or updated
-Review payroll setup (tax accounts, employee forms, rates, salaries, direct deposit).
-Finalize retainer spreadsheet provided by ScheLeese (P24,Matt, Andrew)",https://app2.karbonhq.com/4mTyp9lLRWTC#/work/3XLCk2PHqxH4,,,N/A,0,

She has an Astrology business and says she makes $2k per month for reading and about $10 - $20k a quarter for readings.  She said she made about $133k top line and $70k net this year.  She just submitted the paperwork to convert to an SCorp this year.  [Caroline - If we can ask her for said paperwork as well to double check it was correct.. she might have to do the late election].  

She's kind of a mess.  She's working with tax attorney's on settling her debt with the IRS.  She's super nice and fully admits that she hates doing this stuff.  Also said her tax person said that her books were great and she said she knows she can do it, she just hates it.  

She said she just converted to an SCorp this year so needs a payroll set up.  Talked through QBO as well as different payroll platforms.  She seems partial to Xero but feel like she is flexible to anything.  Her big thing is being able to forecast cash flows in the system which I think both systems would be able to do.  She says she does some of her services on Stripe and some on Wix (I don't remember which one is which).  

We talked through salary and because of her quarterly cash flows, she doesn't want to pay herself too much cause she is usually in debt, then she collects on a quarterly basis to get even, then back in debt, then even again.  Think there's some cash flow management.  

Talked through BKPG / State & Local taxes and she shook her head immediately and asked if we're able to handle that for her.  

She'll be a great client who doesn't want to be involved in anything.  

The Intake form didn't work for her so waiting on Discovery Docs to build out the Karbon Contacts and work items but think there will be a few of them there.  

Request List:

1. Regular Discovery Documents
2. I have a request for them to pull the transactions from their bank account in excel.  She has everything go into her personal account right now and then she manually sorts it out for her taxes every year (yikes!)
3. Paperwork for S Corp Election

Once we have the docs we can get started with all the set up stuff.  

I think this would be a good fit for Caroline to lead so think she can do the Thank you email for this one.  I'd also remind her to open a business checking account and send her the client resource we have for checking accounts (I think it's in the advisory folder?) as well as the Payroll Proposal which will have the various platforms.  I know Andrew knows the costs of these.  

You can use an email template (just replace my name with yours) and send out discovery docs while Brian O cooks up the proposals (although we don't know any info yet due to lack of intake).",https://app2.karbonhq.com/4mTyp9lLRWTC#/work/2Cbh1nDDP2Mz,,,"I think this will be:

1. QBO Set Up
2. Payroll Set Up
3. Monthly Bookkeeping
4. Payroll? 
5. Tax Prep
6. Local Tax Filings

I'm pretty sure I missed something but she's a good friend of Sean's who has been great to us and she's a small business that doesn't make much yet so let's help her out.  Also think this is one of Sean's first referrals and Sean does a lot of business with us so think we spice this deal up.  Also mentioned she'd get the friends and family.  

I'm thinking: 

Onboarding (BKPG): $250
Onboarding (BKPG): $400 (this is the cost of having the Gusto people set up all the payroll filings)

Those will be due upon completion with no deposit.  

Monthly Bookkeeping - $199
Bi-Weekly Payroll - $75

Bill this on a quarterly basis (i.e. bill for all 3 months of services every quarter) because that's when she gets the money in.

They got some of the estate money in and they were able to pay CO taxes owed in full which means no more CO garnishing. Ross advised them to keep the Fed payment plan in place for now and then keep the rest of the estate money so they can invest and be more liquid (since they've been running on fumes for so long).

She asked when their 2024 taxes would be filed and if we needed anything else and I told her I'd circle back on them and can get them done this week for her. 

She also said that everyone is telling Phil that he's withholding too much on his paycheck, but she said that they filed out their W-4 as MFJ & spouse has a job - which is how I would fill it out too. I told her I'd request their paystubs through Karbon and put it into our tax estimator tool to see where they're falling.

They are closed on Mondays so it gave her a chance to level set and get her ducks in a row.  

On Friday there wasn't anything too concerning, just talked through the questions we've been working through with her throughout the process and think we have it all vetted out.  Close went smoothly! 

On Monday evening, we talked through QBO including the products and services as well as the information imported into the system.  We learned that the old accountants weren't applying payments to invoices so there were $100k of invoices in the system and also explains the massive AR balance we saw on the financials / tax return.  We have the Payments Detail so Andrew will work with P24 to get that side reconciled.  

She also has a bunch of deposits from customers (they do a lot of weddings.. unsure what's the split between Weddings & Walk Ins) which she has in an excel schedule.  They use Honeybooks for the wedding side of the business (which is their Ignition) with Proposals, Invoicing, etc.  The weird thing is that since you need to build an engagement in the HB platform, they use QB invoicing for Walk Ins.  Andrew to work with P24 to help reconcile her Excel sheet to HB as well. 

During the call we just moved all invoicing to HB which she liked a lot to keep everything in one place and also so that the workers don't need access to QB in general.  That's a win! 

She's going to build out the HB platform and also change the bank accounts over but we said we'd be available if she needs us!

He says when they were talking to the Company about it, they said their support team was awesome and their Accounting/Finance modules integrate with QBO easily but Brett said he had his Dad (who is a CPA) on the call who asked some pretty rudimentary questions and they had no idea.

"Jun 3, 2025",Prospect/Client,,,,,,,,,,,Work Item Has Been Created,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Dat Le,"Mitched called me about his current expansions in the Mortgage space and how the CFO & Consultant they brought in both think 3PM was at critical risk which I think is a bit shallow.  The company is growing by 200%, the issue is Mitch is going full tilt in growth mode (I also think Mitch is taking a decent amount of distributions).  

He said he mostly brought on the Consultant because they are trying to land his wife's Realtor/Mortgage portfolio for a Joint Venture they are working on.  The interim CFO company is something that same guy pushed for so Mitch was essentially bringing them in to help facilitate an ""Acquisition"" of sorts.  I think he pays them like $5k a month and think we can easily win that business. 

The bigger thing he wanted to talk about was Three Point Insurance.  Mitch has been studying for his Homeowner's insurance license to be the Broker of Record on homeowners policies.  When closing on a house, the Mortgage originators basically have full control over what homeowners insurance they get upon closing and the first year premiums are usually included in closing costs.  Basically Mitch wants to use 3PI for all the insurance policies for mortgages they close on and earn the X% of commission off the deal.  It'd be an additional commission off what they are already getting on the Mortgage side.  He said in the insurance world, regardless if you go through a broker or go directly to the insurance agency (like State Farm) the prices are the same.  

Where I think this is typical Used Car Salesman Mitch, I don't know anyone who has any idea what their homeowners insurance is so they kind of just pay whatever.  Think a periodic ""Audit"" would help a lot of people.  

Mitch wants to start a new LLC that is owned by 3PM.  I believe it'll be a SMLLC for now so we'll need a proposal for that.  Brian, also create a new Karbon contact for this one. 

Also Connor mentioned going from Cash to Accrual for 3PM overall and think they want to move forward with it.  I don't think the conversation will be too bad but I think this gives us an opportunity to level set on the 3PM contract overall which is well overdue.  

Sidenote - Andrew, please get in the habit of debriefs after client meetings.  I don't think I've seen any come through and I know we meet with them weekly with potential new work items like this. 

Mitch scheduled a call for me tomorrow but think we create a proposal for 3PM for the work we're doing with separate bookkeeping proposals for all of their JVs.  I think we talked during the Accounting meeting that we have payroll for them but don't think we are doing any payroll services for them.   

Andrew to come up with a Monthly Bookkeeping fee for 3PM (as the TopCo where a bulk of the work is being done) along with monthly amounts for each Branch based on activity.  Take into account we'll have to do all of this on an accrual basis so pricing this with a fresh look of ""This is one big business with a handful of small subsidiaries on an accrual basis"".

First time meeting Drew - they're a funny couple and both super smart financially (in different ways). They have a lot of different considerations:
- RISEilience
- SE retirement considerations for Krystle
- Drew's equity grants
- the house renovations (energy credits)
- cash flow considerations given the house renos
- hiring the kids for the business

Notes for RISEilience side of things:
- krystle bought a one person sauna for the business (still no fridge)
- Krystle got the sober home deal so shes expecting 8-9K to come in from that soon
- she got a 25k rebate on the HVAC loan
- shes switched around credit cards to offload some of the debt onto one with no interest for 12 months
- they're going to most likely put the kids on payroll and pay a year end bonus which they could then put into a 529 plan (Dat & Caroline to research limits for 529 plans) or into a brokerage account of some sort

Notes on the house:
- they still dont have walls, windows, or heat!
- they're going to track the renos and items they buy that might be eligible for the home energy efficiency credits

Notes on Drew's equity grants:
- he gets 150k of them each year roughly
- he gets 50k of that in january and then the rest is spread out
- he emailed them to ask if they can stop selling grants to pay taxes on the grants since hes using us for tax planning and they have carryover losses that they can use for some of the gains
- drew also mentioned off hand that he wants to update his w-4 to stop withholding on his salary (not smart! and scares us), this is probably coming from his aggressive financial planner friend, so once we do the analysis he should then know to not do that
- he wants to utilize tax loss harvesting for 2025 but also wants to keep in mind that 2026 will probably be an even better year so he's mindful of things they can do now in 2025 to then still have excess carryovers in 2026

next steps:
- Dat to send them a sample deliverable of the equity stock analysis/planning + discuss pricing w/ them (converting riseilience + them into an advisory set up)
- Caroline to request: equity comp statements, drew's latest paystub, brokerage statements, mid year items (should be templates in the financial planning work items that I can use & change wording to be tax)
- Caroline and Dat to do the tax estimator calc and see where they're falling at the mid year point

The business has been around for a couple years but they haven't done any accounting and have no CFO.  

Also - everything is under Chris Johnson's name on paper but the ACTUAL ownership breakdown is tracked which I took a picture of.  I had this conversation with Mark but keeping it as a SMLLC just makes it so much easier from a compliance / set up standpoint so they kept everything on paper to CJ but the actuals are all tracked offline.  All the contracts are signed and everything is ready to go, they just don't really have a reason to do it because the company isn't really even making money yet.  

Essentially it's 3 companies, 

TopCo: CannaLean
Main Operations: CL Scientific LLC
CBD Syrup LLC: CBD line of the product that they are looking to launch retail.  

Because it's Cannabis - the money can't cross state lines otherwise everyone goes to jail cause it's still illegal federally.  CL Scientific LLC is the company based out of California that is where all the products are sold.  They are essentially a distributor on paper (compliance work around) and currently have 5 SKUs but Kenny/CJ want to get to 10 by the end of 2025.  CJ is the Chemist by trade but also a hippie.  

They are looking to put together a forecast but with no accounting work being done, it makes it kind of tough.  They actually have a pretty legit financial model that I think they paid someone to build out.  I give it an A- honestly, not too shabby.  

He sent over a bunch of information as well as added me to their Sales Platform (Nabis) and I also opened a QBO account for him while we were there.  I don't think the platforms interface directly but I think there are connectors out there.  Either way, he sent me a bunch of reports from the dashboard and that's more for forecasting than anything.  

I added Damion Peterson (I think it's a part owner and wants a bigger cut) to QBO along with Kenny.  Sent them instructions to sync the biz bank account and go back as far as they can.  That'll give us the actuals we need for the forecast.  

For the assumptions, he actually already built that out in the old model and sent us their budgets and all that information.  Kenny has a finance background and I think the group is pretty polished in general so we have a shit load of information.   

This will be: 

[A] - Business Valuation (with full forecast)
[B] - QBO Set Up / Onboarding with full accounting catch up

"May 24, 2025",Prospect/Client,,,,,,,,,,,Work Item Has Been Created,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Dat Le,"Shania Roper (Shade & Travel LLC) referred us one of her friends from New Jersey.  She works in New York but lived in New Jersey.  Her employer has had her as a New York resident until May 2025 but she's been in New Jersey for the past 3 years.  

The funny thing is that once HR finally updated her payroll to reflect that she's a Non-Resident of NY, she saw that her local taxes went away but also saw that her federal withholdings went down as well.  It seems weird to me because if anything, if her state taxes went down (no longer paying NY local taxes) than her Taxable Income would go up but maybe it's because she will owe more in NJ taxes.  

I did ALFRED research (below) and drafted one of those tax estimators for her.  She's typically been a Turbo Taxer so I'm not sure if she used to owe in NJ and/or NY.  Either way, seems like something has been fucked up between the state taxes with her payroll.  I'll ask for her prior tax returns to confirm this but ALFRED research says she's on pace to owe like $800 from a federal standpoint.

ALFRED RESEARCH:

I have a client who's employer just updated her address from New York City to New Jersey.  That eliminated her residential / local tax but her federal withholdings also went down.  Why would that be?  

ChatGPT said:
Great question, Dat — and this is one of those sneaky “why is this happening?” payroll moments that surprises clients all the time. Let’s break it down:

🎯 Why Did Federal Withholding Decrease After Moving from NYC to NJ?
While the move from New York City to New Jersey removed local (city) tax obligations — which can be hefty — the reduction in federal withholding likely stems from how payroll tax withholding calculations work, especially in relation to:

🏡 1. Changes in the Employee’s Withholding Profile
When the employer updated her address:

It may have triggered a re-evaluation of her withholding allowances/exemptions or withholding tax form settings (W-4).

NJ has no local income tax, unlike NYC which has progressive local taxes up to ~3.876%.

Some payroll systems adjust federal withholding amounts based on expected state/local tax burdens to avoid over-withholding, particularly if the employee is using the ""standard deduction"" method on the W-4 rather than specifying dollar amounts.

👉 In short: If she was over-withheld in NYC to accommodate both local and federal taxes and now only has NJ state tax, her employer's system may have pulled back federal withholding to better reflect her net after-tax income.

💸 2. Difference in State Tax Withholding Approaches
NYC withholding is higher due to the combined NY State + NY City rates.

New Jersey withholding is lower — and has no city-level income tax. NJ uses marginal rates, starting at 1.4% and increasing based on income.

The overall state/local tax burden drop reduces the total tax estimate, so some systems automatically adjust federal withholdings to balance out total deductions.

🧾 3. How Payroll Software Estimates Tax Liability
Many large payroll providers (ADP, Gusto, Intuit, etc.) use algorithms that:

Look at total tax burden (federal + state + local)

Calculate target withholding to avoid over/underpayment

Adjust federal withholdings dynamically, especially if no dollar amount is locked in on a W-4

If your client had their W-4 set to “standard” with no extra dollar amounts or dependents listed, then any address change can tweak the algorithm’s inputs and nudge federal withholding accordingly.

🛠️ What Should You (or She) Do Now?
Review the latest pay stub side by side with one from before the move.

Compare Fed Withholding, State Withholding, and Local (if any).

See if the employer updated her W-4 or state tax form (some employers require separate NJ state W-4).

Run a withholding check-up:

Use the IRS Tax Withholding Estimator to see if the new withholding is appropriate based on expected income.

Consider filing a new W-4 with specific dollar withholding if she wants more withheld federally.

For 2025 tax season planning:

She may get a slightly larger refund — or owe less — since she's avoiding NYC tax.

Make sure to estimate NJ tax properly, especially if she’s a NJ resident but works in NYC — because she might still owe NY nonresident taxes on wages.

📌 Bottom Line
Yes, federal withholding dropping makes sense — not because the federal tax changed, but because the payroll system recalculated the expected total tax burden with a lighter state/local load.

Let me know if you'd like me to run a mock calculation or review a pay stub (with sensitive info redacted) to give her peace of mind — or if she’s a Motta client, we can run it through ALFRED Ai for a quick projection and prep a tax strategy doc.






You said:
So if the client moved from NYC to New Jersey, it's possible her overall tax burden is less or do you think she was overwithholding before and when she updated her address, they reassessed her federal withholdings? I'm just trying to gauge if the move to the different state was the factor in lowering the federal withholdings
ChatGPT said:
Excellent clarification, and you're thinking about this the right way.

✅ Short Answer:
Yes — the move to New Jersey is likely the reason federal withholding dropped, but not because federal tax rates changed. Instead, it's because:

Payroll systems often adjust federal withholding to keep the total withholding (federal + state + local) in balance with projected liability.

Let’s unpack it further.

🧠 Two Scenarios (Both May Be True):
🅰️ She Was Overwithholding Before
If she lived in NYC and had:

NY State + NYC local tax withheld, and

Used a default W-4 (no extra withholding or dependents)

Then her total withholding burden was higher — so the payroll system likely withheld more federal to match expected year-end totals. This is pretty common in high-tax jurisdictions, where systems aim to avoid under-withholding across the board.

🅱️ Her Move Prompted a Systemic Reassessment
When her address changed:

The payroll system likely re-ran her tax configuration using NJ state rules, which do not include city-level tax and have a different withholding table altogether.

Because her expected state/local tax liability dropped, the system may have reduced the federal withholding to compensate, trying to keep her net take-home pay more level.

Think of it like this:

In some cases, federal withholding is used like a counterweight to keep total taxes withheld roughly aligned with annual expectations, unless the employee manually overrides it on the W-4.

💡 A Useful Analogy:
Imagine her paycheck is a pie:

NYC took a thick slice (State + Local)

NJ takes a smaller slice (State only)

Now, the system sees, “Hey, she doesn’t owe NYC tax anymore,” so it:

Keeps her take-home pay roughly the same

Reduces the federal slice slightly to maintain the new balance

This isn’t the IRS being generous — it’s the employer’s payroll algorithm doing its best to stay accurate.

🔍 Recommendation
To confirm all this, check:

W-4 Form – See if she had extra withholdings before or if she left it standard.

Before vs. After Pay Stubs – Compare line-by-line (federal, state, local) for any % shifts.

Year-to-date Withholding Totals – This gives the clearest picture of where things stand relative to expected tax.

📊 Summary
Factor	Did it change her federal tax liability?	Did it change her federal withholding?
Move from NYC to NJ	❌ No	✅ Yes — due to payroll recalculation
Local tax eliminated	✅ Yes	✅ Yes
NJ’s lower tax rates	✅ Yes	✅ Yes (indirectly)
W-4 update	Possibly	✅ Yes (if new info was input)

So yes — the move is very likely the catalyst that triggered a recalculation, even if her federal tax liability didn’t technically change.

Is it possible because of the drop in federal withholdings, she would have to owe at the end of the year? From what I understand, state + local taxes could be deductible so if anything, I would think the federal taxes would go up
ChatGPT said:
Dat — you’re right to dig deeper here. This is a great question, and you're catching the subtle distinction between withholding mechanics and actual year-end tax liability.

Let’s clarify the key moving parts:

📉 Why Federal Withholding Went Down
This is a payroll calculation issue, not a change in her actual federal tax liability. The drop likely reflects:

The elimination of NYC local tax, and

The payroll system trying to maintain similar take-home pay by adjusting federal withholding.

But...

Federal withholding is just an estimate — if it’s too low, she’ll owe at tax time. If it’s too high, she’ll get a refund.

🧮 So Will She Owe at Year-End?
➤ Yes, she could owe — and here’s why:
State + Local Taxes Are Only Partially Deductible

The IRS caps SALT (State and Local Tax) deductions at $10,000.

In NYC, between state and local, she may have hit or exceeded that cap.

Now in NJ, with no city tax and potentially lower state tax, her SALT deduction may shrink, but not her federal income or federal bracket.

If her employer reduced withholding too much, she may be under-withheld for federal purposes — especially if:

She earns six figures and her marginal tax rate is high

She had no other adjustments (like extra W-4 withholding or estimated payments)

If she itemized before, and her SALT deduction was maxed out, moving to NJ may not help or hurt much on federal taxes. But if she didn’t hit the $10K cap before, she could now lose deduction room — making her federal taxable income higher.

🧠 Bottom Line: Withholding vs. Liability
Concept	Did It Likely Change?	Impact
Federal Tax Liability	Probably not much, unless she loses SALT deductions	Could stay the same or increase slightly
Federal Withholding	✅ Yes — decreased due to payroll recalculation	Might be too low
SALT Deduction (on Schedule A)	Possibly lower now	Could slightly increase federal taxable income

If withholding dropped and she doesn’t adjust her W-4 or make quarterly payments, yes, she might owe.

🛡️ What You Can Do As Her CPA:
Run a mid-year tax projection using her new withholding rate and compare to last year’s tax liability.

Estimate NJ tax vs. NY+NYC last year — is she actually saving? If so, that may help offset the lower SALT deduction.

Consider recommending a W-4 adjustment (e.g. line 4(c): extra amount withheld from each paycheck).

Check if she’s still itemizing — many don’t post-TCJA unless they have high mortgage, SALT, and charity.

🧾 Quick Recap for Client-Facing Language:
“Your employer likely lowered your federal withholding to reflect your reduced state and local taxes, but that doesn't mean your federal tax bill went down. In fact, you could owe more if you're under-withheld — especially if you lost some of the state tax deduction on your federal return. Let’s run a quick midyear checkup to make sure you’re on track.”

Assuming no changes to their tax profile, what would you project for their taxes due at the end of the year.  Should they adjust their withholdings?
ChatGPT said:
Based on the payroll data from April and May 2025, here’s a projected snapshot of Amanda's year-end situation assuming nothing changes in her tax profile:

📊 Annual Federal Tax Withholding Projection (2025)
Metric	Estimate
Average Gross Pay (biweekly)	$3,076.93
Estimated Annual Gross Wages	$80,000
Average Federal Withholding (biweekly)	~$334.69
Estimated Federal Tax Withheld (Annual)	$8,682

🧾 Now, Compare to Estimated Federal Tax Liability
Assuming Amanda:

Is single (filing Single status)

Takes the standard deduction (projected at $14,600 for 2025)

Has no children, no major deductions or credits

Her estimated federal taxable income would be:

bash
Copy
Edit
$80,000 – $14,600 = $65,400 taxable income
2025 federal tax brackets (projected):

10% on first ~$11,600

12% on ~$11,601–$47,150

22% on $47,151–$100,525

Estimated tax:

10% of $11,600 = $1,160

12% of $35,550 = $4,266

22% of $18,250 = $4,015
→ Total estimated tax: ≈ $9,441

⚠️ Result: Underwithholding Risk
Federal Tax Liability (estimated)	~$9,441
Projected Withholding	~$8,682
Potential Shortfall	~$759

✅ Recommendations
1. Adjust Withholding Now
To avoid underpayment penalties or a surprise tax bill:

Amanda could file a new W-4 and increase her withholding by about $30–$40 per paycheck (biweekly) to close the gap.

2. Monitor New Jersey Withholding
Currently, no NJ withholding appears on the pay stubs, which is critical. She may still owe NJ state tax even though she works in NYC, unless her employer is properly withholding NJ tax now and you just don’t have that pay stub.

🧠 Heads up: If she lives in NJ and works in NYC, NY State taxes will still apply, but she’ll be eligible for a credit on her NJ return for taxes paid to NY.

🧩 Final Thought
The drop in federal withholding seems modest but could be meaningful over the year. Combine that with possible shifts in SALT deductibility, and yes — she’s at risk of owing both federal and state at year-end if adjustments aren’t made.

What would she get back from the state? She was not a local of New York for any of 2025


ChatGPT said:
If your client resided in New Jersey for the entirety of 2025 but worked in New York, she would still be subject to New York State income tax on her earnings. New York taxes nonresidents on income earned within the state, including wages from employment physically performed in New York. Therefore, she must file a New York nonresident return (Form IT-203) to report and pay taxes on her New York–sourced income.

However, as a New Jersey resident, she can claim a credit on her New Jersey return for the taxes paid to New York, mitigating the risk of double taxation. This credit is typically claimed on the New Jersey return using Form NJ-1040, Schedule A.

Regarding refunds, if her employer withheld New York State income tax throughout the year, and her total New York tax liability is less than the amount withheld, she may be entitled to a refund of the overpaid amount. The exact refund amount would depend on her total income, deductions, credits, and the amount of tax withheld.

It's important to note that while she is not liable for New York City personal income tax as a nonresident, she may still be subject to other taxes, such as the Metropolitan Commuter Transportation Mobility Tax (MCTMT), if applicable.

I first met him during NBA Summer League at a J Cole concert at Zouk (work obviously) when he first started CannaLean. 

Kenny is a brilliant dude from Atlanta and just finished his doctorate program at UNLV.  He's super involved with the university and the black community here overall.  He's on a bunch of Cannabis Boards, Real estate stuff, etc.  He's from Atlanta originally (he referred us Clay) but he's settled into Vegas.  He's Married (wife's name is Lauren) and they have a daughter named Kennedy.  

He gave me the run down of CannaLean but they are in a lot of stores right now and have all the sales data as they white label their products.  They don't do anything or have anyone doing their Finances, Accounting, or Taxes right now.  He actually asked me if I would be willing to exchange services for equity which I would be open to.   

This is a business valuation including forecast which we will have to scrap together based on Sales Data reports basically.  I think Andrew can help with the Valuation.  I think he's going to want to set up a QBO account so I think I'm going to do that for him.  He just got back from Oakland today and then leaving for a Cruise tomorrow night so I'm going to meet up with him on Saturday morning in order to get this started.  

He says he has enough cash to get them through the end of the year but if they want to expand or anything like that than he needs capital but before that he needs Accounting.  He's super savvy with finances so he gets what we need to do.  

Chris Johnson (the chemist of CannaLean) is currently the sole owner on Paper but Kenny does all the finance stuff.  He says CannaLean will probably be between $150k - $250k in 2025 and growing fast (store expansion, product growth, etc.) but he says he's got a bunch of inventory in 1 SKU but sold out in 2 other SKUs that are super super high demand.  

He also said he wants to expand CBD because it's more widely used and he can get those drinks in retail stores easier.  

I'll know more about pricing tomorrow after I talk to him but there's a possibility that I might take this job on my own (or maybe a Motta investment sub?) to be there Finance Arm for this company but not sure on that yet.  

He's given me a ton of free product over the past few years and has been a good friend of mine.

I have a client (Drive Motor Company on Freemont Street in Las Vegas) who is going through a Sales Tax Audit.  They had gone through the audit and had the closing meeting and signed the closing letter but then they re-opened the audit and told him they are going from a Sample Audit to a Full Audit so he's reaching out for representation.  This is a new type of project for us, can you do a full analysis of the situation and a comprehensive guide on what might have happened and how we should handle this project? Also project request lists and instructions on steps for both Motta and the client


ChatGPT said:
Thanks for the thorough background, Dat. This is indeed a high-stakes situation for your client, Drive Motor Company, and it’s a great opportunity for Motta to extend its expertise into sales tax audit defense work. Below is a comprehensive breakdown of the situation, including legal context, project strategy, and action items for both Motta and the client.

🔍 Situation Analysis: Sample vs. Full Sales Tax Audit
📌 What Likely Happened
Drive Motor Company was initially under a sample-based audit—a common method where the auditor reviews a subset of transactions to extrapolate findings across the entire audit period. After the closing meeting and signed audit letter, the audit was reopened and expanded into a full audit. This shift typically happens when:

Material Errors or Omissions Were Found
The sample results raised red flags that warranted deeper inspection (e.g., underreported taxable sales, use tax gaps, resale certificate misuse).

New Information Emerged
The department may have received third-party data (supplier records, DMV records, etc.) contradicting filed returns.

Procedural Mistake or Internal Review Triggered Reopening
Rare, but sometimes internal QA flags incorrect audit closure.

Taxpayer Statements During or After Closing
If the taxpayer inadvertently disclosed additional details post-closing (like during a “final chat” or responding to a follow-up letter), the audit may be lawfully reactivated.

🧭 Motta's Strategic Response Plan
1. Client Representation Scope
Confirm with the client what’s already been provided to the state.

Request a full audit workpaper file from the auditor (and, if denied, file a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request or local equivalent).

Prepare a Power of Attorney (POA) to handle communications directly.

2. Audit Reopening Legality Review
Verify Nevada’s administrative code or regulations under NAC 372 and NRS Chapter 360–372 to assess whether the reopening was lawful.

Typical reopening must occur within the statute of limitations (e.g., 3 years), unless fraud, substantial underreporting, or a waiver is involved.

3. Damage Control: Preserve the Closing Agreement
Determine if the initial signed closing agreement was binding.

Was it a “preliminary closing” pending final supervisor approval, or a “final determination”? Legal definitions here matter.

4. Full Audit Management
Prepare to provide full transactional detail:

General ledger, POS system exports, customer invoices, and exemption documentation.

Ensure use tax compliance is fully supported (i.e., out-of-state purchases).

Review industry-specific risks (vehicle trade-ins, DMV filings, off-book cash deals).

5. Build a Defense Narrative
Tell a proactive, consistent story: explain accounting system limitations, new controls in place, and offer credible reconciliation plans.

We talked through fee structure with Ross and he was $100 in.

Talked through how we'd basically do all the work and for him it's some tax revenue (which he couldn't even offer before) as well as how it could be a great lead generator for his Financial Planning practice.. that really resonated with him I think.

At Crimson Rd, one of the tenants is $1700 behind and he's late this month with next month due in a couple of weeks.   

For her 6313 Village property, the tenant is a sweet girl but the people who moved in above her are loud / crazy which has been a nightmare.

They use QBO online for everything, so that is good.  He did mention they still write a lot of checks for bills but would want us to transition that to all ACH if possible.

We discussed payment plans, abatement possibilities and offer in compromise. Dean is going to submit an application for offer in compromise and he is going to try for abatement. we told him to not get his hopes up but worth a shot. we are going to file 2024 without the final k-1 as he needs to be up to date on all taxes for the offer in compromise application. if the k-1 comes in with income we will amend 2024 when it happens (or potentially just true up the k-1 #s in 2025 if its in a small loss like PY).

- Caroline to file 2024

Everything is going well. walked through some of Andrew questions and finished connecting payroll for Stable Conference. 

Amir let us know he will be breaking off into his own solo RIA. Plans to work mainly from home. He seemed excited about and it will make it easier for us to work together.  He will get us own company emails when he set up his new firm and plan to use the same tax software that we have. 

He is going to talk to the guy who the 2 companies with outstanding proposals within the next week, so he will let us know about those, but was happy with the numbers we sent him. 

Action Item Caroline:  Can you research best practice for setting up an Accountable Plan between the Amir S-Corp and Amir.  I had never heard of an accountable plan before but said we would send over our best practices for setting one up. Research below but basicall a contract between the business and Amir.  We should look into setting these up for some of our other S-Corp owners. S-Corps are not eligilble for home office deduction, so this is one way to claim those expenses. 

what is an accountable plan for an s-corp and owner to have in place.
 
ChatGPT said:
An accountable plan is a reimbursement arrangement that allows an S-Corp to reimburse employees (including owner-employees) for business-related expenses without counting those reimbursements as taxable income—as long as the IRS requirements are met.
For an S-Corporation, having a formal accountable plan in place is especially important for owner-employees, since they are not sole proprietors and cannot deduct unreimbursed business expenses on their personal return (due to TCJA changes).
🧾 IRS Requirements for an Accountable Plan
To qualify as an accountable plan, the reimbursement arrangement must meet three conditions:
Business Connection
Expenses must have a legitimate business purpose.
Examples: mileage, home office, supplies, business travel, cell phone use.
Substantiation
The employee (owner or staff) must document expenses with receipts, mileage logs, etc.
Must be submitted to the company within a reasonable time (typically 60 days).
Return of Excess Reimbursements
If more money is advanced than the actual expense, the employee must return the excess promptly (typically within 120 days).
🧾 Common Expenses Reimbursed via Accountable Plan
Home office expenses (portion of rent, utilities, internet)
Business mileage (IRS standard mileage rate)
Cell phone or internet use (business portion only)
Meals & entertainment (50% deductible for meals, if business-related)
Travel & lodging for business trips
Continuing education or certifications
📄 What Should the Plan Include?
Here’s what a basic written accountable plan policy should address:
Who is eligible (e.g., all employees, officers)
Types of reimbursable expenses
Requirement for documentation and timely submission
Repayment of excess advances
Statement that non-business or undocumented expenses are not reimbursed
📂 You should keep it in your corporate records, and apply it consistently to all reimbursements.
💸 Why It Matters for an S-Corp Owner
Without an accountable plan, reimbursements become taxable wages, subject to:
Income tax
Payroll taxes (Social Security & Medicare)
This can lead to higher tax liability and IRS scrutiny.
✅ Example Workflow
Owner incurs a $200 internet bill for a home office used 40% for business.
Submits a reimbursement request with a copy of the bill and usage breakdown.
S-Corp reimburses 40% of the bill ($80) via payroll or ACH, not included in W-2.
Company deducts the $80 as a business expense.",https://app2.karbonhq.com/4mTyp9lLRWTC#/work/3PSYqX5h6P8D,,,n/a,0,
"May 15, 2025",Prospect/Client,,,,,,,,,,,Work Item Has Been Created,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Andrew Gianares,"Sharon and Dat first time meeting each other. Sharon is their fractional CFO and just came on a few months ago and has finished her 1 month close. Feels bad about Connor spending so much time with her to understand the business. 

April updates with the SBA loan received for 146k. 6/1 13k bill for annual sales vista subscription. Need to create a prepaid. Connor is going to bringing on 16 new people while speaking in robot form. July 1st is the target date for them to join on. JV associated partner setup. They wanted to start their own company, setting up EIN but Connor said just come with us and we will just charge a filing fee. Gaining a lot of traction and the word is getting out. Projected to bring 50 new people on by year end based on current growth. Each JV that gets brought on is bringing on more gross margin to cover overhead costs. Connor is getting backed up and trying to bring on more supporting staff. Looking at a business line of credit right around June. 

The goal is get market share and expand. 3PM covers all fixed costs like benefits, software, etc. 3PM is making about 30% topline. 

The 16 new people is one branch which are tied of running their own company and 3PM isn't doing a buyout with them and more of affiliation structure. 3PM has a great employee retention rate. 

3PM is working on a insurance platform. They found them from L&L and they are located in South Dakota. Turns out Insurance JV exist and partnered with credit unions. Connor wants to setting up a 3PM insurance company and 3PM should own that sector and wants Sharon to help with the structure. 

Dat provided Sharon with basic background of where he is located and from. Sharon is watching ocean 11 series on Netflix. Talking about streaming services and Connor was stating that comcast is offering a streamsaver that offer like apple tv so maybe cable might be coming back and everything is the getting to be the same cost eventually.

Sharon wanted some words of wisdom. Mitch was introduced to Dat in Nov of 2023. Started out at 200k topline and now is over 2 mil. Dat and Mitch get along besides Mitch being a Nuggets fan. Strap in with all this growth with the JV's and can become stressful on the cash flow standpoint. For Ex: 2025 Q1 cash flow was extremely tight bringing on the JV during the slower months. 

Sharon was part of tech startup for 30 years doing CFO work. 3PM is more of an controlled path and pretty much 3PM is at a breakeven point and Sharon was shocked about that. 

3PM is gaining traction based on their infrastructure. Initially people didn't trust the process. It is now a proven concept and people are gravitating towards them which is great. A lot of organic growth.

The last 20 minutes, Andrew and Connor were just reviewing the current accounting setup and to make sure it is on the right track. There is still some work to do but it is on the right track overall as they start growing.",https://app2.karbonhq.com/4mTyp9lLRWTC#/work/3ns9kqWrDMjc,,,N/A,0,
"May 15, 2025",Prospect/Client,,,,,,,,,,,Work Item Has Been Created,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Andrew Gianares,"Dat met Sharon for the first time today. Sharon is 3PM fractional CFO that has been on for the last 2 months. She has been learning a lot with Connor and 3PM to get her up to speed. 

They received a SBA loan for 146k. Sales vista annual subscription for like 13k will be coming out on 6/1. Will need to make this a prepaid. Connor is bring on a 16 person team and then became a robot so missed some other items. 

The group he is planning on bringing on is not a merger and they were going to start their own company but then Connor told them to just join them since they have everything setup with a structure in place so he is working on this. 7/1 is the target date. 

3PM is moving quick with these JV's being setup. If everything goes well, Connor thinks probably hiring about 50 people by the end of the year. Looking into a business line of credit and may be implemented in June.

The goal is market share and expansion. They have good employee retention. Connor found this guy from L&L which is from SD. Working on a insurance platform for June 1st but reality would be July 1st. They also work with credit unions as well. 3PM would owns the insurance sector and will aid in the revenue stream. 

Sharon asked how Dat pronounces his name and  where he located currently and where is was originally from. Sharon has been rewatching the ocean 11, 12 series on Netflix. Talking streaming services and probably eventually go back cable etc. Before Connor was leaving Comcast, they were implementing streamsaver which allows you to gain access to all the streaming services like apple tv. 

Sharon asked Dat for some words of wisdom since she has only been a CFO for 2 months with 3PM. Dat was introduced to Mitch around Nov of 2023. Get along with Mitch and a lot of same thought process besides Mitch being a Nuggets fan. Mitch started an LLC with a top line of 200k and now is surpassing over 2 mil. Strap on due to bringing on all these JV's which can be stressful at times. Bringing on JV's and growth expansion with benefits but then it adds additional cost to bring them on. 

Sharon was a tech start up CFO for 30 years with SaaS companies. 3PM is more controlled and she put all of the data for 3PM and found out it was breakeven position and was shocked but it is a good starting point. 

3PM infrastructure is giving confidence and it has been proven that their concept is working. Starting out as 9 employees and they are now  at 35. The word is getting out which enhances organic growth. 

Connor and Andrew is just going over the accounting setup and making sure everything is getting allocated properly. Still a work in progress but way better for the future months.",https://app2.karbonhq.com/4mTyp9lLRWTC#/work/3sy6Y5QpVZPY,,,N/A,0,
"May 14, 2025",Prospect/Client,,,,,,,,,,,Work Item Has Been Created,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Andrew Gianares,"Andrew and Dat briefly chatting about internal schedules and meeting before Krystle joined the meeting. Krystle surpassed the annual sales from last year in just 4 months in 2025 so she is right on track. She also received an reward from the chamber of commerce as new business of the year which should help her growth as the summer months come. 

Devil's advocate and thinking about COGS in depth to see if there are any other GA expenses that can be COGS. Rent can be considered COGS since she needs the space in order to perform her services. Dat mentioning internal COGS with Andrew with time tracking hours to see billable vs how much time was spent. Internal training/coaching session as we wait for Krystle. 

Krystle has a lot of things on her plate like Drew being in FL due to his mother not doing well and now she had to teach yoga with her kids in the studio before school. Super unfortunate. 

A year ago she was just 4 days into her lease and now has surpassed her annual sales. Super exciting. 

Krystle has a few items in the works. She is working with a hotel about a summer residency where her instructors teach on the pool deck from End of May-Labor day for the next 5 years with possible ventures to have this opened up to the public. It is looking a flat rate and she proposed a 70/30 split. Offering Krystle any help for any future review of contracts to make sure the numbers and the cost associated makes sense. 

Krystle will be graduating from her yoga training on 6/1. She won't be hosting her own graduating party and will be hosted at the studio. ""Krystle is not a narcissist."" This is another reason is to be able to host her own class incase last minute changes with her instructors or they can't make it which is why she was a little late to the meeting. 

Dat is trying to get Krystle to start adding pastry dishes. Krystle is starting to promote within since she is growing pretty quickly which will allow her to create strategies against competitors in the area and grow the business. 

Landlord has confidence in her growth and offered her half rent for a few months. More sublease tenants she charges to cover the rent cost. She is working on an SBA loan for 34k but the interest rate was 13%. She is now working with Newburyport Bank to see what they can offer. She will also be getting the HVAC loan rebate of 25k. She also got a new credit card with US Bank and can defer interest for 18 months. 10k limit on the new card. 

SBA loan allocation and whether or not to pay off the debt or invest more into the business to increase sales instead of saving about 100/month on interest. If she invests more into her business, the loan would be paid off a lot quicker as well as have capital to still operate the business. 

Meals tax reporting and making sure she has the reports through toast for her monthly filings with MA. 

Tax talk- How do you project the business on a profitability standpoint for the year and Drew getting a bunch of grants this year that will cash out eventually. They have a carry over loss from 2024 which will help offset some of this. They are going to be liquidating it because now their house is sinking and doing a lot of work on the house since they live on a river. Her bottom floor has 3 walls instead of 4. They are trying to put in more beams and demolishing the foundation.

On final review, it showed he had ~$2.8k in gambling winnings and I thought to myself ""There's no way that mf-er was net positive three racks for the year"". I said that to Al verbatim and he goes ""Is my name Encore? Nah that just funded future gambling losses"".  He's going on his Wynn app to get his losses but he was super jazzed up about the refund.  He asked if he was getting audited.  I said if they want to check the books than we will sick OCP on the IRS and they will not have a good time.  Plus it makes sense because they weren't taking credit for a lot of expenses and generally not taking credit for a lot of other low hanging fruit and Al has a W2 job with eversource.  2023 was a bad year for them so a refund should have happened to begin with. 

Al also talked about how his wife has a studio of some kind or a space that she rents out.  The person she works with is trying to rent a bigger space and wants to talk through some sort of partnership arrangement but she's lost on how to do all that stuff.  I'm not sure if she'll end up going through with it but I'll call it an Advisory | Entity Formation lead.  I told Al to talk to Mark about it.

Dat, Caroline & Andrew met with Brandon Miller and Kelly (I think Kelly does all the admin work for Lendmire?). 

Brandon walked through his plan for the business (again... and he has a very slow southern accent) and asked for some reassurance on the tax side and that he should switch to an s-corp and start running payroll instead of just taking draws. Lendmire will be a 2025 first year S-Corp tax return with a minimum of 11 states. He's taking about 10k in draws/month now so it makes sense to switch it to payroll instead. Kelly is going to get payroll set up for him so no action needed from Motta. We explained that the reasonable salary should be 60% of the business income and the remaining 40% would be distributions. Also explained that he can still take 'draws' if he needs to take more money one month etc. 

Eventually Andrew was able to walk him through the state allocation classes in quickbooks (why the call was scheduled in the first place, but it took 30 min for Brandon to get there). Brandon and Kelly are now educated to build the state classes and rules in quickbooks so they can track by state (this will be a huge help with taxes). They need to assign classes to all transactions since Jan 1 2025 so they have some work to do.

At the end of the call (while we were saying bye) he circled back to the s-corp stuff again and I told him the process again. He's going to let me know when he gets on payroll and he might file the s-corp form then or we'll file it with the 2025 return. i told him if he wants to file it when he goes on payroll thats fine just scan a copy i can attach to the return for proof tht it was submitted.

Overall they are in a great spot and they're being proactive with getting things done and organized the right way so that's super appreciated.

Action Items: I made the 2025 work item for the Lendmire S-Corp return (link below), Brian - can you please add this to the 2026 resource planning?

He's a ""Single, high W2, owns nothing, not diversified"". He's basically the same profile as Cary. He had sent me a photo of his tax return last year (think I tagged to work item) and I sent out full doc requests for 2024 to build a profile. I think he'll at least be a Financial Planning client since he has a bunch of money just in a regular savings. Pretty much same as Cary. He'll make between $225 - $230 between base and commission with a majority being commission. He's Head of Sponsorships at Resorts World and Cary's boss.
In a previous Debrief I mentioned his aunt is a Prepper so he still might have her do the prep work (she honestly probably doesn't want to) but he doesn't know anything about finances (similar to Cary) so looking to be more thoughtful about his finances cause he just bought a house.
He closes on 6/1 and there's a Sale / Lease back so he'll be a landlord for a month. He brought up he doesn't have a side hustle and not diversified so he didn't think he would have avenues for deductions but luckily I remembered her mentioned that on the golf course. That's what makes me elite. I think there is opportunity for renovations while the property is a rental. He sent me his tax (and financial planning) docs so I'll talk to him about what we can do in June to maximize on tax savings.
I'm not sure if he'll end up doing prep with us but most likely. We'll charge him something but think he's a good avenue for new clients (similar to how Cary has been a big advocate which has helped us grow in Nevada) and also an opener of doors in Las Vegas. He's also a good friend of mine and will most likely be a Financial Planning FGA client for Mark so I'll work with Brian for a proposal.

As I'm the 6th man for any of the Sponsorship friends, I was called upon to fill the spot and fulfilled my role on the ""Stay Ready Crew"" valiantly.  

Kevin is the Account Manager from Coca Cola who oversees the Resorts World account.  He replaced Corey Woods who left Reyes for Coca Cola Corporate.  Kevin's a great dude but Dre and I say it all the time that he's ""Not Corey"" as Corey is one of our close friends.  

Golf tournament was fun.  It was Cary Jacobson, Solomon Schwartz, and Kevin Horton.   The crazy thing about what is happening but Aly was the only person in our friend group who asked me for help on taxes our first year doing it (and Cary obv) but now it's getting trendy to do so.  Sol's aunt is a Tax Prepper and she did his taxes but he asked me for some tax advice last year and he also just brought a home so said he'll be calling me for taxes this year.  I'm not sure if it's tax planning or tax prep but I think it's a 2025 tax prep prospect either way.  He didn't refer Heather Conway (his GF) to his aunt so thinking he'll be over this year.  

The round was actually a decent amount of Business Development.  I don't really talk about taxes or anything.. Sol bought a house so talked through mortgages, interest rates, etc. and then Kevin asked some questions about Real Estate and some tax stuff because him and his wife owed two years in a row but nothing changed.  He asked if we do individual taxes and I said we do everything.  He said he'll be swinging our way for taxes this year and as he was saying it, Cary was walking by and go..

He just started taking classes on n8n. So he was excited to hear that, thats what we were recommended to use. 

He was just picking my brain on automation and AI, in the accounting space. He was trying to create his own app but wants to see if he could potentially apply it to other areas. He seemed impress with my knowledge of the spaces and our connections. Told him about Tekys and had him look up Anyquest.  He was super impressed, when i told him about the AI agents anyquest offers. 

He wants to have another meeting and he wants to do some research and prepare and see if he can bring us some info on whats possible for us with AI agents.  I told him we love having these conversations and happy to continue them. I said i would add Dat to our next call. 

He is having twins in July or august and they want to sell their MN house before that. Need to some estimated tax payments on the capital gain when the time comes.

Scheleese is an Attorney (not sure what kind) and her husband is a Financial Analyst.  She has already purchased TeeLee Floral and Events [Sidenote, Brian O - The business contact wasn't created so I created it to do this Debrief].  But the business owners are 3 friends who don't have any business sense.  They are selling the business for 1x Net Income ($190k) and not using a business broker.  Comparable businesses are selling for 4x... 

She says they basically have no formal infrastructure and that one of the owners who is in charge of Client Relations is the person doing deliveries for all orders so she doesn't have time to do any relationship type work.  The business was trying to be prudent and didn't want to outsource/hire for someone to do deliveries.. 

She doesn't need a full on analysis or valuation but she said she'd like us to do a check of the QuickBooks, Review the returns, and do a Compliance check on the business before she buys it.  This is sort of like what Synergy should have done with Jeremy before they bought NFC.  I'll lead the charge for this along with OCP on the Accounting side and Caroline on Tax and Mark on Compliance.  Basically just want to make sure the business is up to date.  She thinks they had a CPA and their books are pretty clean so she said they ~should be fine but wanted to be safe.  This is essentially the same as doing a final inspection before closing when you buy a house. 

She also talked about Post Acquisition so talked through Bookkeeping, Payroll, and ongoing compliance.  She already has access to their QBO and said once we get the requests out she'll send over docs ASAP.  She's a bit nervous about this acquisition and said that if the business does well, she wants to quit her job and do this full time.  

She asked for tax services as well so I said that would be easy.  I think this will be a decently big project to help with the acquisition but could expand as she enters the entrepreneur life.  

 

[1] - Review QBO to ensure there's nothing glaring. Basically do an inspection of it.  {OCP}

[2] - Caroline to Review tax returns

[3] - Mark and/or Caroline to check if the business is in good standing with registrations.  They also have sales and use tax so let's make sure they're current.  

[4] - Proposal: 

[a] - This is basically a Due Diligence job which I don't think we've really done yet but I'd use the same service as we did with Cam for the JetSki business.  I said for the Due Diligence (QBO Review, Tax Review, Compliance Check) it would be less than $1,500 all together.  This includes the consult from today and whatever else she needs between now and closing.  I think we do it around $2,500 gross and $1000 net. I said we don't need to do the full assessment because she already bought it so think she's good with it. 

[b] - Onboarding: Andrew to Assess but think she said books are pretty clean

[c] - Bookkeeping & Payroll: I said this company would typically be between $450 - $650 but said it'd be on the lower end of that (but also think she'd need Payroll & Sales / Use Tax) so thinking around $450/$500.  Defer to OCP on this.  

[d] - Taxes: Her husband does their taxes now and was uncomfortable when they were W2 works so asked if we can do the business and personal taxes.  She is not sure if they'll be an SCorp this year (I think she'll be Schedule C).  We talked about bundling so think we can do the 1040 with Schedule C for $200.",https://app2.karbonhq.com/4mTyp9lLRWTC#/work/2YgFrpbXtW85,0,0,See above,0,CO_BLOUNT_ROSS_0061

Please see the ""Tax Post Mortem"" work item which was discussed last Friday.  We should re-brand this work item but I think it's more like an ""Internal Projects 2025"" work item for each of our respective areas.  

I've also created a section under tasks for all of the WORKING Karbon templates that are out there.  Similar to our tax template, these work items are the most current draft of the Karbon templates.  For example, the old tax template didn't have the requests for Bank Account info with the Draft return and didn't have the Client Testimonial task under the Final Return (Previously it's own section).  With all of these templates, the idea is to use these to make our continuous improvements to these work items and save them down as Karbon Work Templates.  

Best,

Caroline & Andrew were on the call so I'll keep the Debrief a little more brief but I'll pin the Meeting Summary & Recordings to the work items.  

Good segway because I spent more time itemizing the work items for everything they have going on but also might be missing some.  

Overall I'd like to itemize out the services to each of the respective entities but ultimately I think there's enough going on to be a Motta Advisory client.  I want to keep the Bookkeeping & Payroll (i.e. recurring items) but I'd like to talk through how to allocate the other services so that we can still track them but also bill it under ""Tax Advisory"" because that's the recurring monthly subscription for all of these services.  

Caroline & Andrew should be up to speed on what we have to do and think some of those work items are already created but I'll create the respective work items.

The original entity was formed as a Partnership with her ex boyfriend when she still lived in NYC.  His father was an attorney and they have since dissolved the entity and finalized everything in 2024.  

Established the new entity in Nevada and put the registration fees on the Corporate Card.  She has a travel trip to Belize coming up and one of her clients is a bartender and paid her in cash so she just paid me in cash.  I said it would be $500 total and the total registration fees was like $425 or something.  She also wanted registered agent services so that can be the additional $75.  

She doesn't need an Operating Agreement (SMLLC) so just registration and EIN for this one.

He's a mortgage broker (Lendmire LLC) like 3PM so they have all the same state registration requirements similar to that mortgage space.  This will be an Andrew  job.  

But first, from a tax standpoint.. Lendmire LLC is a Sole Prop right now because he's been operating at a loss for the first few years but says he's already made enough profits to cover the carry over loss as of 4/30 so he's already breakeven from a tax standpoint.  He's most likely going to see a decent profit this year so talked through LLC vs SCorp and the salary requirements there.   

[1] - Financial Statement Compilation (Cash -> Accrual)

He has a CPA right now but the guy is in his late 60's and is looking to retire.  He is looking for a new CPA because he is trying to get Financial Statements in accrual form for his Tennessee mortgage registration.  

He also is looking to expand nationally and dump the profits into infrastructure (getting registered/licensed in every state, hiring more mortgage officers in different states, etc.) so he's looking to expand to Tennessee cause it's right next door and California because it's a massive market.  He's also looking to do Illonois and Oklahoma soon as well.  These states usually need Financial Statements compiled by a CPA on an accrual basis (Andrew has done this before) and Tennessee is the priority right now.  His current CPA said they would need to do a full on audit if he's going to compile the financials which is stupid.  They also said it would take at least 3 months to do and that he was currently traveling across the country in an RV.  He's basically retired and Brandon was like ""Yeah good for you and all but I'm trying to grow a business"".  


He uses QBO which he'll give us access to and he uses Gusto for Payroll.  He has an Operations person who does all the accounting, payroll, operations, etc. for the entire business.  She'll be a key contact.  

[2] - Consulting | QBO by state

He was dead set on wanting to track all of his revenue and expenses by state so he's looking to build that out in QuickBooks.  He said they can probably map all of their revenue and expenses by state right now if he meets with his Ops person for a few hours.  He also said they're gonna start checking transactions a few times a week to make sure they are going to the right state.  I said this was probably overkill and we could do a state apportionment from a tax standpoint but he wanted to do this for internal business purposes as well (track which state is doing better or worse).  

He said he'd like help with all of that and also helping with mapping employees by state in Gusto into QBO as well.  

He said he's reconciled with bank statements through 12/31 but hasn't done anything in 2025 yet because he was about to do this overhaul.  He said he'll get all the information for 2025 reconciled then mapped to states and we can use that as a template to build out the pending states (Cali, Tennessee, etc.).",https://app2.karbonhq.com/4mTyp9lLRWTC#/work/24Cgt2vNHLqW,,,"He asked about fees and I said usually when a client is looking to do different things, it's more advantageous to bundle the services together but I'd send him our fee schedule (including the consulting sheet Sophia just made).  

He said he's not cash flowing too strong right now and it might be tough to commit to a giant fixed fee bundle so he'd rather do an Hourly basis.  I'm fine with this.  He's a good guy and from talking to him, he's thinking about this in all the right ways and super diligent.  He doesn't seem like a Mitch Mortgage person.. more like a Todd Mortgage person... hopefully.  

I think the FS Compilation will be $799 or whatever.  Bring it down to $600.  

I also said how we often help with CPA Verification and he was jazzed about that so he'll keep us in mind.  Overall he was pretty excited because the old CPA seemed good but old and not looking to go a the same pace he is.  Brandon seems like a smart / good dude overall..

"Apr 28, 2025",Prospect/Client,No,,,,,,,,,,No Work Item Needed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Caught up with Heather via text and then Sol (Heather is a nurse and this is super not her thing so Sol helps translate) via phone call.  Both people were super impressed.  

The change was that Heather thought that if the child is over 18 than they can't be claimed anymore.  She also sent me a picture of the divorce agreement that said that Lola would be claimed by the father from 2011 until 2023 when Lola was emancipated (I believe when she turned 18) but the question is whether or not the father claimed Lola in 2023 which would be huge.  The agreement says they alternate years for who gets to claim their son Cian until he turns 18 as well.  

Key word in all that is that the dad can claim Lola UNTIL 2023 when she was emancipated so it's possible that he didn't claim her on her taxes because she was 18 at that point.  What the agreement didn't consider is that you can still claim a child past 18 if they are in college so if the father didn't claim her because she was 18, Heather could because Lola lived with Heather and the father is pretty out of the picture so doesn't pay for any of the kid's expenses.  

I explained to Sol that a decent Tax person would be able to identity that Lola can still be claimed as a dependent which is only a $500 credit but gets the HoH designation which is pretty clutch for the tax rates and standard deduction.  Kobe used to say he wasn't worried about the primary defender guarding him because he knew he already had him beat but he was always looking at the help defender to see how he was going to beat him.  Turn that into what I'm about to tell you but the Help Defender in this situation is the American Opportunity Credit.  She made below the Income Threshold (think it's like $90k or something) to qualify and she pays for all of Lola's education expenses so got an extra tax credit for that.  Also the state of Arizona gives a tax credit for fees paid to public schools so got those fees for Cian as well.  

All in all it was $5k for each year (2023 and 2024).  2024 is approved by her and she signed the signature, also verified bank account info already.  Caroline to take a final review but this should be good to file. 

Sol is going to find out if Lola was claimed in 2023 and will confirm that once he finds out.  Sol also said to invoice him for whatever it costs to do all of this.  I think we have his Gmail so just invoice him for 2024 but under Heather's name.  I know I originally said comp it so Brian did the right thing in showing the $0 for her because we need to get a signed proposal from the person we're filing the taxes for but also send an invoice or separate proposal TO SOLOMAN SCHWARTZ'S GMAIL but still label it under Heather's client contact.  I think this is similar to how we did it for Shane O'Shea / Lauren Vargo.

They filed an extension in 2023 so they didn't actually file these until October of 2024. Their H&R block advisor did a horrible job of preparing them for the capital gain and basically told them the gain would be excluded - and then flipped the story at tax time since they hadn't lived there for two of the past five years (which is correct, but the delivery/lack of consulting on it was horrible). They had owned the house for 20 years but moved to CO in 2019, and decided to rent the house to a family friend (for the same amount as the mortgage), and then sold it in 2023. so they got hit with roughly 68K of taxes due. they have not paid any of it yet, and stephanies wages are being garnished by CO. Stephanie was super upset/stressed on the call, understandably so. 

Plan is for Caroline to look at payment options through the IRS pro account and send them to Stephanie/Phil, ideally we get a payment plan to start on June 1st. We need to simultaneously be working on getting the W7 done for the estate so that they can get the money from the estate to then pay off the taxes.

Victoria was actually super normal and nice which was honestly kind of a let down.  I didn't get to see how she was as a barber but from my brief view of it, I think she's still getting comfortable with technique.  For the record I wasn't pre judging her based on her profession but I had a phone conversation with her and her license picture makes her seem like an absolute mess of a person.  Turns out, pretty sweet person.  She asked if we had yelp or what she can do to help because she's been so blown away working with us.  I'm actually not sure if we have a Yelp... or Google Reviews for that matter.  Maybe Brian O looks into this.  

I also meant to talk to her about her 2022 & 2023 tax filings but it was kind of crowded and then thought to myself asking her about her tax filings would be blowing up her spot about not filing her taxes.  Plus I didn't remember that she didn't file those years returns and haven't thought about what we're going to charge her.  Her Barber technique and her top line Velvetine LLC sales doesn't lend itself to this being a lucrative client.  I'll let Caroline/Brian draft a proposal and we can talk through via the work item.

She filed her 2024 taxes with Cain and got a call from her Ex Husband because it was his year to claim Cain.  She filed an amendment and then owed tons of money because she was now a Single Filer without any of the Child deductions / credits.  

Sol called me about it and asked about claiming Lola as a dependent.   Lola is 20 (I think) and is attending college.  Based on ALFRED research (including below), she can definitely claim Lola as {1} she lives with Heather for over 50% of the year (i.e. while she's not at school and ALFRED says that living away at school counts as living with Heather) {2} she covers ALL of the kid expenses. I guess it was not a great divorce and don't think they have a great relationship as Heather says he doesn't help with tuition or anything like that {4} Lola is under 24 and attending college.  

Heather was super insecure because she said her ex husband has always done the taxes and she's been doing it herself on TurboTax but she doesn't have any help.  She also felt bad that she messed up the dependent thing and didn't understand the tax rules all together.  I guess she filed the amendment without thinking because her ex husband was upset and trying to file his taxes so she blasted the amendment out there.  

This will be a 2023 and 2024 amendment (second amendment for 2024..) to include Lola as a dependent on her returns.  

This is a Business Development client so I'll brief Brian on pricing for this one but Sol said he'd cover the invoice either way.  

More amendments! Leave it to the pros.. folks!

Can you claim your client who is over 18 as a depdendant? They lived with them for more than half the year (also went to college) but covers over half their expenses


ChatGPT said:
Yes, it's possible to claim a client over age 18 as a dependent under certain conditions — but it depends on whether they qualify as a Qualifying Child or a Qualifying Relative under IRS rules. Let’s break this down for your scenario:

✅ Potential Eligibility as a Qualifying Child
Since you mentioned the client is over 18 and attending college, we need to consider whether they qualify under the ""student"" exception to the age rule.

Requirements for a Qualifying Child:
Relationship: They must be your child, stepchild, foster child, sibling, stepsibling, or a descendant of any of them.

Age:

Must be under 19 OR

Under 24 and a full-time student for at least 5 months of the year.

No age limit if permanently and totally disabled.

Residency: Must live with you for more than half the year (time away at college counts as living with you).

Support: They cannot have provided more than half of their own support during the year.

Joint Return: They didn’t file a joint return unless it was only to claim a refund.

➡️ Key Catch Here: If they cover more than half of their own expenses, they may fail the support test for a qualifying child. That alone would disqualify them under this category.

🧐 Can They Qualify as a Qualifying Relative?
If they don't qualify as a qualifying child, check for qualifying relative status instead.

Requirements for a Qualifying Relative:
Not a qualifying child of anyone else.

Relationship or residence: Must either live with you all year as a member of your household OR be related to you in a way that does not require living with you.

Gross income: Their gross income for the year must be less than $4,700 (2023 threshold; indexed annually).

You must provide more than half their total support.

➡️ Another Key Catch: You said they cover more than half of their own expenses, so unless their total support is still mostly coming from you (or the client you represent), they likely wouldn’t qualify here either.

Summary

Test	Requirement	Likely Outcome
Qualifying Child	Under 24 and full-time student	✅ Possibly, if they didn’t provide >50% of their own support
Qualifying Relative	Gross income under limit + you provide >50% of support	❌ Likely fails if they covered most of their expenses
What You Should Do
Run a support worksheet (Pub 501 has a good one) to get the exact breakdown of support provided.

Confirm whether the client paid more than half of the individual's total support, not just ""expenses.""

Be careful if they file their own return — especially if they claim themselves.

Let me know if you'd like to walk through a support worksheet or need help modeling out the support split. We can run some numbers together.",https://app2.karbonhq.com/4mTyp9lLRWTC#/work/2kSnbb5fLhcB,,,,,

Client: Cam Iacomini
Motta: DL3

Caught up with Cam for about 20 minutes.  He's been in Philly for the past couple of months working on some showrooms or kitchens or both.  I asked if it was about the Jetski business but he has a whole other venture he wanted to talk about (a couple actually) but he has an opportunity with a Condo complex / Race Track down in North Carolina. Cam just heard about it and was super interested so reached out from a Renegade perspective to do the contracting work on their kitchens / showrooms.  

He met with one of the founders and really vibe'd well with him and the guy asked if he wanted to buy into the business for $1M which Cam declined immediately due to lack of resources.  He invited Cam to an investor meeting they are having this evening (4/24) about updates on the project.  I guess they have like 500 acres of land that they are clearing out.  It started as a condo complex but then some billionaire investor wanted to build a race track so they made it a race track condo complex.  He says the track is just below F1 so it can host some minor league races (I know they have F2 at least).  

Cam said he can't do it for a million but had about $150k he could come up with.  He wanted to see if he could work out a deal where Renegade does the work for a discounted price in exchange for discounted equity.  He also said Renegade could also be the contractors for the Racetrack and condo complex so looking to create more of a partnership type deal.  Seems like he got along really well with that founder guy and they are as interested as he is so curious to see what they work out but I think there's a deal to be made.  He said the projected opening for this wouldn't be for 5 years but it would be work for Renegade while they are building it.  He was even saying if they finish one of the condos than the Renegade team would just live in there and they wouldn't have to pay for housing which is usually $100k of the project costs.  

On another note, Cam had texted me about sending merch from Renegade Motorsports which is a TShirt company that he's also looking to start.  He said he just needs a printing machine and he has a ton of people asking if he can make shirts because he had a TShirt company back in the day.  He has the wholesale prices with the companies so he would just need a printing machine and he can make shirts.  I asked if it was worth it if it would take away from the Racetrack opportunity.  Especially because this would dovetail with his dreams of using all his cars as a business.  He also said the founder of this racetrack is working on a contract with Porsche and is down in ATL at the headquarters all the time.  He suspects that they are trying to create some sort of development space for the team or something.  Cam has an old Porsche so this could fit in a lot of ways.  

Talked about the JetSki business for a little bit.  I but a quick analysis together for it but at the end of the day I told him it wasn't worth it.  This is what he pays us $1k a month for.  Talk through these business opportunities, do some quick math and tell him if it's a bad idea or not.  He said he is never doing to do a deal again without calling his accountants.  We don't have to charge him anything for the JetSki business so Brian O, close that work item out and put as ""Completed"".  Also send him a Proposal at $0 for this.  P24 took the sheets and turned it into excel and I turned it into a quick analysis but less than $1k worth of consulting hours so we'll count this towards advisory.  

From a Motta standpoint, he doesn't have any other LLCs opened for any of these so as these come about, he'll need LLCs and all of that.  I'm also talking to him on Friday to help him build his DeathStar",https://app2.karbonhq.com/4mTyp9lLRWTC#/work/shhbnVnPmR1,,,,,

Said he's known him for a couple of years because Tanmay has a rental property and starting to get into the Seller Financed space (where Corey & Sally have a large RE portfolio).  Seems like he's more a business Partner for Corey.  

Tanmay is in Austin and has lived there for a few years but was in Dallas/Houston for the last 10 years or so.  

Also note that he asked Corey for the tax docs related to the Seller Financed JV they have so Corey will probably have another business entity somewhere.  I remember he had a couple entities that he didn't file or something like that because there was no activity.  I remember he's a huge mess.  

Tanmay is a W2 start up that has Ai drone technology.  He says they don't really have a product yet and they have about 3 months worth of runway before they go out of business so he's been applying for jobs.  Said I have a friend in Austin (Pat Toma who I know from Steward, he's my BOY) so happy to connect them if it'll help.  

From a tax standpoint he said he usually did his own taxes and tried a CPA a couple years ago and the person only recorded 1/4 1099's from his brokerage accounts so he got a letter from the IRS that he's still dealing with.  He said he did his own taxes last year but he has a Rental Property, this new Seller Financed business, he got married and had a kid over the past year or so... he was looking for a CPA cause things are more spicy now so he was skeptical but Corey said we were good? That was surprising.

She is very smart, said she was in investments in a prior role but didnt get into details on the front. But she manages all of their investments, mentioned brokerage accts, 529s, and created a trust for her kids last year as well. On the investment side of things that is not something she wants help with. 

Her focus is on planning for her vesting RSUs and 100k increase in her husband's salary. One of her concerns is they are only withholding 22% in taxes for her vested RSUs but they might be in the 35% tax bracket in 2025. Wants help calculating W4 withholdings and if they should be paying additional estimates taxes. 

Wants to plan to use RSUs to buy a second home in the future but how to plan to do that tax efficiently as far as exiting the RSUs. She said their AGI could be north of 600k in 2025 and the following years

He's looking for us to review his 2022 taxes and file his 2023 and 2024 taxes. He also says he's about 1500 transactions behind. No payroll or anything like that and he's a SMLLC. Most likely could use a S Corp conversion to like Cam.

Let's talk about pricing cause this will be a 1 time expensive Tax Return vs Bookkeeping Onboarding fees. Think I'd rather the ongoing recurring revenue so maybe we cook up a Bookkeeping Proposal.

Cam is a good reference point for pricing although he seems like he's a smaller shop (No Contractors or anything, basically a solo tradesman so maybe closer to Luke).

"Apr 21, 2025",Prospect/Client,No,,,,,,,,,,No Work Item Needed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Caught up with Raquel then debriefed with Harrison which I'll also debrief on.

Raquel is super happy with us and with life in general although the Pennington's have had a crazy year from a career and life standpoint.  I think they've lost 4-5 relatives over the past couple of years including Raquel's grandma who she was close with and Tecia's dad passed away in early 2025.  To Parlay on what Harrison mentioned about the Pennington's going through a rough patch.  Raquel said Tecia jumped right into another fight camp after her dad passed away and has not really processed/dealt with it.  Seemed like Raquel was not happy about her just avoiding the whole thing.  

Raquel on the other hand said she hit rock bottom a couple of months ago after a crazy few years.  She said that was when she was talking to the UFC about the fight and said she's stepping away.  She got married, had a kid, went on a title run, then got screwed out of the title (she said she lost but I don't agree but that whole thing was a roller coaster in itself), she also purchased 4-5 properties over the past 1.5 years or something like that.  Lots of shit going on.  

She says she stepped away and took Alayah to Florida where her Dad's family lives and spent some time (separated) while Tecia's in camp.  Raquel says she hasn't been in the gym in months and she's loving it.  She's enjoying being a mom and going to her family sporting events and just decompressing.  She says she's been spending a lot of time up in the cabin away from it all and doing projects around the property.  She told the UFC not to talk to her again until October.  Later on in the conversation, we talked about the Perm Life insurance policy they got for Alayah so went down a whole rabbit whole with Raquel about how all of that worked.  I told her about the tax advantages of it and how when Alayah is our age that she'll have a hefty cash value that she can borrow against which Raquel said ""These kids, must be nice.. my parents never did this shit!"" 

I said good call from Harrison and that her and Tecia probably have the same thing.  Raquel said she couldn't because she's a professional fighter (Harrison then told me that he found her a broker that would cover her but that required homework from Raquel which never happened) but Tecia had one because she took a year off when she had Alayah so they were able to slip in a Perm Policy while her tax return said she was just a mom.  

I said to Raquel, if you're planning to not even think about fighting again until October.. why not stretch it out to 2026.  She could throw in a Whole Life policy or then a Convertible Term Policy just to get something in place. Parlay that with all her properties and think she'll be over the 50% threshold and the hours requirement to qualify to become a real estate professional.  This will be especially advantageous because she also told me that the UFC is about to pay out a class action lawsuit to athletes which is paying out the second weekend of May.  I think her PPV points are also paying out this year.  That'll all be earned income so if she can be a RE Professional and take big depreciation on her properties (maybe Solar?) than she'll be able to save a ton on taxes....THIS IS A+ TAX & FINANCIAL PLANNING!!!

Told this to Harrison and he says he loves us and wants to get more of his top clients over to us.  He said the most recent tax prepper he worked with advised his client not to do a Roth 401k or Whole Life.. which was very illogical for the situation but the tax person said they shouldn't because there are no tax benefits.  I think the person was in a 20% rate or something.  

He brought up Morgan Fox (Defensive Lineman for the NFL) as well as another friend of his who started a Non-Profit originally to help college athletes with Marketing but has evolved into helping them with NIL deals.  He talked through some payroll questions with that and I talked about a similar business structure to OpenAi (which is technically a Non-Profit that opens a For Profit partnership that funds the Non-Profit Mission).  I think we can parlay this with Aly's business as well as Awab's network through Klutch Sports.  Harrison said he'll get something on the books soon. 

We both agreed that a standing Quarterly meeting would make sense and he brought up he needs to do his stuff too so I think we set up a meeting to go through his Accounting, Taxes, etc.  I'll set the meeting up but Andrew should plan on this being the quarterly meeting with Harrison.",https://app2.karbonhq.com/4mTyp9lLRWTC#/work/4LyjtMdh9nYW,,,,,

He said that last time he talked to Raquel, she shared that her and Tecia were talking about a separation but they were trying to work it out.  Harrison said Tecia was hopeful that they could work it out but he seemed skeptical.  He said he's never talked to them at the same time but has talked to them separately.  

From a Raquel standpoint, she said she was holding off on any changes until her taxes are done so relevant point for us. He has the same struggles we do from the standpoint of getting on the same page with her and getting in touch with her.  I suggested Quarterly meetings with her because she has to do quarterly estimates anyways so think this will help everyone involved and add structure.  

I brought up payroll for Alayah.  From my standpoint, we just needed a bank account set up for Alayah with Harrison but from Harrison's standpoint, he just heard from Raquel ""Alayah is set up on payroll"" without context so he wasn't sure what to do.  He's going to set up a MM account for her and provide the account information.  When I talk to Raquel I'll see how much she wants to come from Team Rocky vs Team Tiny but plan on paying her whatever the Standard Deduction for 2025 would be.  


[1] - Andrew: Take a look at Team Rocky's Payroll.  She got a letter from the Colorado Dept of Payroll or something too so let's get eyes on that.  I have her Chase (personal) bank account somewhere. Please also confirm that it will be pulling from her business account.  Harrison will send over Alayah's bank account info by EOD.

He asked what I do and I said taxes and his face lit up. He said he's switched CPAs 4-5 times in the past few years cause all he's finding in Washington State is old tax peppers. He asked me for my biz card and also specifically asked for my number / email cause he just fired his CPA this week.",,,,,,

Talked to Luke Harlow for about 30 minutes, he's Cam Iacomini's younger brother.  He just turned 20 on the 9th (for DOB purposes).  He does finish carpentry and also some general contractor work.  He lives at home in NH right now in the Concord area but moving to Boston on June 1st to the Fenway area because his girlfriend goes to BU.  He also says a lot of his work is in Boston as well so it works out.  

He is a SMLLC (he said as much) which I explained is the same as a Sole Prop.  He also has QBO so we'll send him instructions for that.  Also asked him to send his prior year tax return so Brian O to resend client requests so he can upload all that stuff.  

I don't think he'll have any Home Office / Vehicle deductions.  He lives at home right now and he got his car for free from his uncle.  He also only pays $150 for insurance on two cars right now cause it's still under his Dad's or something.  He says he tracks his mileage though.  He said he also has some old school Porsche that he got for $500 and fixed up (he says it's street legal and he did a vinyl wrap on it.. total cost $4k for a vintage Porsche).

Should be an easy 1040 Schedule C.  He asked about pricing because he'd need some clean up work on transactions in 2024.  He says he probably has about 100 transactions a month and made around $35k - $40k total last year and says he's made $20k this year so hopefully will make at least $44k.  Just a kid starting out in the Carpentry world.  Tradesmen are this generation's millionaires because they weren't conned into going to a 4 year college and get stuck with a giant student loan.  I'm not bitter.  Anyways, I said I'd do the 1040C for $199.  

He also said Cam couldn't be more complimentary on how we do the monthly accounting for him so he asked if we can help him with that.  He'll be tiny so I said we'd do it for $99 per month.  Easily an Automate / P24 job but ANOTHA Bookkeeping client!

Waived the onboarding fee because he was doing bookkeeping and him being on QBO alone makes it easier to do all the things we need to do for this proposal so include Onboarding but discount down to $0.",https://app2.karbonhq.com/4mTyp9lLRWTC#/work/2Lv8hH7RTb9s,,,,,

Only questions she had were: 

(1) - David somehow gets things to happen that don't usually happen to people.  All the research I've seen says it's very unlikely that someone gets equity in a company without having to pay any money for it.  This was the case with David. 

David and Amira aren't married yet.  They actually just had to cancel their wedding and got the money back on their venue because it was in Malibu overlooking the Palisades... yikes.  She says they're going to elope and do a small 50 person wedding off the Armani coast in Italy or something? Sounds fancy.  

Anyways, Amira is actually on David's health insurance with Coca Cola even though they aren't married. Not sure how they got that to go down but she CANT contribute to her HSA.  I removed that from her return.  She's going to contribute to her IRA.  

On the Wealth Mgmt front, I had noted their fees were a bit high and Amira said that David's uncle started a company and exited for like a zillion dollars so works with a giant wealth management shop.  He was able to get David under their umbrella even though their minimum was like $25m or something.  

Only follow up is that she pointed out that she didn't withhold any taxes on her W2 and she's not sure why that happened.  I'm guessing something is not set up property in Gusto.  This might be related to the issues I saw on Triage related to her and the NV Unemployment stuff? Idno.  I also also think it might be because the State of Nevada isn't recognizing her EIN as a Nevada business because it's technically tied to the Cali entity.  

For David - There are some things to look into: 

For 2022: His Earned Income went up which I noticed before but Amira caught it.  When I was inputting in the W2, he had contributed to a ROTH but then ProConnect disallowed it because it said he was over the contribution limit but I'm pretty sure it was a ROTH 401k?",https://app2.karbonhq.com/4mTyp9lLRWTC#/work/2DjpSxXvJRMT,,,,,

He's from Woburn but moved to New Jersey with his new Fiance.  

He's always been a W2 so just Turbo Taxed his return himself but all these state taxes with NY/NJ has made it a bit less straightforward.  

He hit me up about an IT-203 which is the tax form for New York Part Time/Non Residents because he works in New Jersey but his employer had about half is wages reported in NY in 2023 and he is doing his taxes this year and it says he owes like $5k to each state.

He should be a LOMAR so sent document requests out.  If he wasn't a close friend of the Partners at Motta, I probably would have been on extension watch (still might be).

He was super grateful from the tax return standpoint (initially had his bill at like $12k but talked to Blackburn about opportunities and got it down to like.. $5k).  He signed the return while we were on the call, the only thing he wanted to talk through was if he needed to do the IRA contribution before we filed.  I explained we don't, we just need to make the contribution by 4/15.  

We talked through Altruist and I re-explained the accounts we opened (Cash, Traditional, ROTH) and why the Backdoor Roth makes sense.  I remember talking to him about doing it for 2023 but we didn't have the RIA set up at that point so we asked him to open it and he had no idea how to do it and didn't have time to talk through it (neither did we).  He was in a 19% effective tax rate in 2023 and I think 22% in 2024.  In talking to Mikey, he got a ~$75k bonus in 2024 and just got a $200k bonus in 2025 so his tax bracket is going to jump in the current year.  He says he's due for a promotion soon and not planning to leave that place anytime soon so think he'll be a very high W2 earner for the indefinite future.  I said this is why the Backdoor Roth makes sense from a tax efficiency & financial diversification standpoint.  

This is a textbook example of the value of a CPA/CFP firm.  Typical Preppers would view Mikey has a LOMAR client and we would classify Mikey as the same.. from a tax standpoint.  The efforts we're going through right now for not a lot of money probably won us his Financial Planning business for life.  Mikey is already considered a HNW individual and only going up so think he'll be a good long term individual client.  

He asked if there was a Log In with Altruist for him and doesn't think he ever set anything up.  He's going to do the Forgot Password thing when he gets home because his work Wifi doesn't allow him to do anything.  He says he can't even get into his personal Gmail while at work.

Most of the call was talking about how he has another kid on the way and the struggles he faced when opening Crown.. the Entrepreneur's journey.  

Manny apologized for being late and wasn't intentional but he did admit that this stuff (Taxes, finances, etc.) gives him anxiety and he's never been taught any of it so he's super uncomfortable with it.  He also didn't get a lot of help throughout his life in this area so made me think how much more of that is out there and how much of an impact we can make. 

I clarified with Manny on the Crown return that Thomas was no longer involved in 2024 and the paperwork to get him off the business happened late 2023, early 2024 (he doesn't remember exactly but it was the winter time).  

Manny's 2023 return was pretty bare for a Business Owner.  I Facetime'd with him to get the home office deduction and got the amounts for his home office / vehicle expenses for 2024. I think there's opportunity for tax savings potentially but let's get 2024 done first.   

One thing to note is that he got rid of the Mercedes a couple of weeks ago (needed a car for all the kids) and got a Jeep Wrangler.  We should note that for his 2025 taxes, I'll text him for that.  

He also tried to give me his IRS log in because he wanted to throw us the keys ASAP but I instead got POA while on the call.  

His Partner (not married but together for 11 years.  They file separately) takes credit for the Mortgage, Kids, etc. which I said might not be wise because he pays a lot more in taxes than she does.  She works at BioGen and think she's decently high up there.  She also has a small side hustle where she sells Clothing or Jewelry? I forget but he said he thinks she already filed her taxes but he's going to introduce us to take over her Business / Personal.  

He was super grateful for all the help and said the Motta team is part of the family.

He took out $420k {blaze it!} and withheld the standard 20%.  He had thought because he had it for so long that it would fall under Capital Gains (15%) but I clarified with him that since it's coming from a Pre Tax Account.. he never paid taxes on that money vs if it was a regular brokerage account (post tax), you would only pay the taxes on the gain because you already paid taxes on the funds you put into the account.  That clicked for him.  

I said if he's planning to do anything than to talk to a CPA first and he asked if he could be a client for 2025 (called it!).  He turns 88 next month and his wife (who was in the background) is turning 85 in a few months.  Could be a Estate Planning & Wealth Management client.

(a) Business Valuation (b) Business Advisory Review & Assessment (c) M&A Consulting Hours   

For the Consulting hours, I was thinking M&A type stuff will be at $349 per hour but do ALFRED research on that to see what market is.  For this project, between converting the document, analysis, and hours spent working with him on the deal.. I'd estimate around 8 hours.

I completed all 3 years (2021 -> 2023) of amendments as well as Amira's 2024 return (A LOT of Caroline's help with Amira and her businesses.  I guess Andrew probably contributed too).  

She also asked me to check 2021 because she did it herself so I prepped the entire return and also did some scenario analysis to see if it made sense to move expenses one way or the other with David.  There were no changes and that was a complete waste of time. 

Also created a pretty impressive analysis of the Before vs After.  No lie and I didn't do this on purpose, the total refund between David/Amira totaled $69k... that's how I knew it was the right answer.  

Talked them through the changes.  Biggest item being the Escalade in 2021 where they were able to get the Section 179 expense (100% business use and over 6k pounds) which helped him in some big tax years.  He owed in 2023 because he overpaid with their extension so when they filed, he had a $16k credit which they elected to apply to the 2024 return.  The problem with that is although the tax number went down, the IRS has already credited his 2024 payment when the 2023 return was filed and you can't undo that.  This means when we amended, the IRS considered it a payment.  He would have originally received a $10.8k refund but since the $17k was a credit.. he ended up owing $6k in 2023.  He also owed $11k in 2024 but I think it was close to $19k on the first draft.  

Amira is digging back to 2023 & 2024 for expenses related to Highlite.  The accountant didn't let David deduct business expenses unless the expenses related directly to an event... I don't know where that accountant got their logic).  

David also asked what the next action items were to get this done and if we were waiting on anything from him because he's going to be out of pocket at Coachella.  He specifically asked if he owes us any money and I said I had sent some proposals their way.  ***David said emails from us seem automated so he just ignores them***  They are 'automated' but they are important, David.  

Amira brought up that we still need to do the change of domicile for Melon Marketing from CA to NV (Caroline knows about this).  

2021: David's return was finalized and mailed
2022: Finalized and sent for eSig
2023 & 2024: Amira looking for additional Biz expenses

Amira 2024: Sent for Sig
Melon: Move from CA -> NV

Registered Agent services: All entities

Think we already had a bookkeeping/payroll/2024 tax prep proposal under Melon.  

[1] - Brian O: Add Comprehensive Tax Review for Amira's proposal but discount down to $0.  I just want to track the work.     

[2] - Brian O: Summarize all the proposals for the Rokeaches (Caroline/Andrew will know all the projects open with them) and send them an email with all the proposals out there.  This is similar to when we send out an email to a client with multiple proposals so we can keep it separate but not make it confusing to the client.  I should have done the same thing instead of blasting 3 proposals at him.

"Apr 10, 2025",Prospect/Client,No,,,,,,,,,,No Work Item Needed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Talked to Clay who was a referral from Kenny Contrell of CannaLean (THC Syrup Company and Motta prospect in Vegas) who I've been friends with since moving to Vegas.  

Clay is one of Kenny's best friends from Atlanta where Kenny is originally from (I think this is our first Georgia client?) but Clay has an SCorp and a couple Schedule C's.  He said he used to flip houses and needs to get his numbers ready for a loan because he has a meeting with Andrew Tate / his brother as well as some Saudi's who he says has money.  

His SCorp is his main business and is a Mitigation Water Restoration firm or something? I have no idea. Maybe someone can do some research on this guy.  He seems like a Mitch Hamilton type.  He said he was going to Dubai to meet with those people and they might be investing in his company.  He plans to do the Synergy type business model with water restoration type firms? He was saying there was upside to the relationship because as he acquires the companies, we'd do the accounting.  I explained how we're experienced with that and how engaging us early can help integrate the companies and make the overall company more scalable instead of looking at 37 different types of financials.  

He said his bookkeeper had a death in the family that really hit her hard.  He said she's done all his accounting through 2024 but haven't done any accounting for 2025.  He also says she's older and is a bit old school with how she does things.  He says he finds himself learning about the accounting/tax rules and teaching it to her.  He said it's good to learn but I said it should be the other way around and how we approach things different.  He's looking for someone who can handle the numbers and help him come up with tax savings strategies.  

He asked about pricing so ballparked $999 for SCorp and $700 for his personal.  He also needs his accounting caught up for 2025 and ongoing bookkeeping services.  I do think there's some upside here so I can be flexible on the tax side but it's also April 10th.  

He gave us access to his QBO when I was on the phone but I think his old Bookkeeper is the primary admin so we were only able to get Standard All Access

[1] - AG to work with Clay to get Primary Admin reassigned

[2] - AG to make the typical Monthly Reports and send to Clay via Karbon.  This will also help us with pricing.  If you can poke around and see what he's paying now for bookkeeping / tax.  

[3] - Brian O to draft a proposal and also send full tax requests. 

[4] - Create a contact for his business and tag this debrief to the timeline.  Create an SCorp return work item as well as an Accounting - Onboarding work item.  Work with AG.  

[5] - Proposal for his (1) business tax return (2) bookkeeping onboarding (3) bookkeeping monthly.  Pricing was provided earlier but I'll let AG & You pricing the Accounting for this one.

[6] - Proposal for his Individual / Schedule Cs.  If there's a way to structure the personal fees over to the business and charge minimal for individual than do that.  

I think he was talking about referrals and upside for his business because he said he's ""Restructuring"" and shedding costs (he said he has two guys working with him that are there but not currently working but will come back if he gets this investor/loan) and also asked for a Friends & Family discount via Kenny.  Where I do agree with those things, it's also 4/10 so can't do too much on the tax side.. maybe accounting.  

Good guy overall and said he's planning on spending a month in Vegas for a business trip so I'm sure I'll meet him eventually.  Could be a decently bigger client and a footprint in Georgia",https://app2.karbonhq.com/4mTyp9lLRWTC#/work/4wk2PWDvjTd9,,,,,

James (I think he goes by Jim?) used to work as a delivery driver for Dominos but now has started doing DoorDash / Uber Eats so he's 1099/Schedule C now.  She said he took a class on how to do Schedule C's but she didn't learn a lot so she tried her best but she said it was probably wrong in 2023.  

I had thought from talking to Jess that she was more skilled in the arts of tax but I don't believe that is the case.  Welp, 2 new clients.  

Jim has a couple 1099s and they sent him his mileage.  I talked through potentially using the direct method for his vehicle cause she says that's basically all he uses his car for.

She made a comment about how Jess said it was so quick and easy through Karbon but she didn't get anything and she had to schedule a meeting.  I explained the process that doc requests usually go out after the intro call.

He was surprised on the amount and just wanted to make sure everything is justifiable so talked through the changes.  I said if anything, the return is more right now so if he gets audited.. everything is easily justified.  

Only change would be to see if moving the Tesla to Amira would help them with overall taxes between the two of them.  Amira also said she did her taxes herself in 2021 so to check her work which I tried to finagle to post 4/15 but she made the point that if there are savings, we'd need to do it before the deadline...

I went through that whole exercise and David has such a higher tax bill in 2022 that it makes sense to keep it where it is so there's NO AMENDMENT FOR AMIRA but now I know about her 2021 taxes a lot more than I did before.

"Apr 9, 2025",Prospect/Client,No,,,,,,,,,,No Work Item Needed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Talked to Meredith & Cole via phone call.  They are referrals from Josh Dutton (3PM).  Tagged the previous texts to the work item but she did not seem like she liked her old CPA and I can see why after the intro call. 

She has a fitness studio (I think this is an additional SCorp) and Cole is a typical farmer type who is part owner in a (1) Mill (2) Dairy Farm (3) Compost Company

(1) Mill company - not sure what they do and how much say Cole has in this business but he says it's open but not active.  It's not running and they are trying to sell the property. 

(2) Dairy Farm - He believes the current accountant is using the wrong bank accounts for this

(3) Composte - I think he owns this company but not 100% sure.  I know they got a letter (similar to the Jolleys) because their son was on the self employed health insurance but it wasn't listed. 

The same tax prepper (He's an adult male and goes by Joey so I immediately don't take him seriously) completely messed up their taxes.  They got denied of a mortgage because there were so many ""Red Flags"" on their 1040 return.  They also had to engage Joey to help them with the mortgage process (because he's the one that did all the work) and he is trying to charge them $7k or something.  This is the same guy that does all of the business accounting and taxes and it seems like this guy is a hack.   During the mortgage process, Meredith said one of the things that failed them was that Cole got income from one of the businesses but Joey never filed the 1099 so that caused a bunch of issues.  Cole also said he doesn't think the guy is taking any deductions for the farm equipment because another red flag was that they didn't see depreciation on the return.  Terrible.  

They need tax prep (and potentially PY clean up but 2024 first) but they were going to need to get extended anyways.   Joey usually doesn't file their taxes until the fall (extension deadline) so their one of those people who have to extend cause they're waiting on K1's.  

From a 1040 standpoint, they are just 4 K1's (basically 1 Schedule E) so their actual indy is easy but there will be some clean up and the variable is what Joey is doing with the businesses.  Because he always did the business AND personal, they've never seen a K1 ever.  It honestly wouldn't be surprising if he's embezzling money but that's a big accusation.  

GlowCo will need an SCorp business return and the Compost business.  They said they both have QBO and I sent them instructions for them to provide us access.  Joey is currently the accountant on it and she didn't want to remove him until we talked but she's probably going to do so shortly.  She hates this guy.  They are actually in a blood feud because they won't pay the invoice for his ""Consulting Fees"" for his help for their failed mortgage attempt.  I told them that he legally has to give him those documents I think but we will also request POA to pull what we can on our side.  

I think this is a ""peel back the onion layers"" client and the upside is that we are able to get 4 business clients from this guy.  This is a 3PM referral so Financial Planning upside as well.  


Action Items

[1] - Brian O to create all the businesses from the 2023 tax return in Karbon.  I think we're at least going to do their 1040 and GlowCo or whatever which I think is an SCorp. I don't know what the other ones are (1065 v SCorp) but those are prospects for now.

[2] - Caroline to request POAs for both of them and also create 2848s for the businesses.  This will be a large poop clean up project.  

[3] - Proposal for 1040 Schedule E.  Think that is around $700 or so.  

[4] - Proposal for SCorp (GlowCo)

He's essentially in Banking / iBanking so the tariffs have caused chaos on his side.  Their deals are based on the market and highly dependent on interest rates so all of this is blowing up a bunch of his deals.  

He's all in on the Backdoor IRA and essentially is on the side of ""I don't know about any of this shit so here are the keys"" and asked what he needed to provide us and I said because he does his taxes with us, we already already have everything.. I just needed his approval to launch.  He said ""Ohh.. Yeah obviously, do whatever"".  I opened a MM, Traditional, and Roth IRA.  The plan is to put $7k into the traditional and immediately convert to a ROTH.

They've had bad FAs in the past so think it helped to get our endorsement.  They said they sold their house in Austin to move to Colorado and the FA told them about the 1031 exchange but they didn't qualify for the 2/5 rule so they got slapped with a $49k tax bill.  Told them about the benefits of us working with Ross to make sure they've got their bases covered.  

She said they were pretty straight forward but I'm confident they are going to be complicated.  I briefed Caroline & OCP on it briefly.  Brian O also helped do some research because Ross emailed us beforehand with the questions, Brian O researched it, then I used the research in Rizz form in order to close the client.  10/10 team effort there.  

So she's W2 and her husband is from the UK (cool accent) and he just started a business that he says is 1 LLC (4 owners) and the ""takeaway"" (British version of take out) portion of the restaurant is open with the rest of it opening in July.  Brian O I think we're going to need a 1065 for the business... I think he put it in the name of the restaurant in the intake form. 

Another complication is that his dad died 3 years ago and from the UK and I don't think ever had a SSN in the US although he had a property and bank accounts here.  They just sold the house but can't get the payout because the company needs a SSN.  We need to get a W7 (which Brian O researched) and think it'll get spicy because his sister is the executor so she'll need to sign the W7 / POA based on my research.. which I'll also post.  

Caroline / Brian to work together to get the full requests and quote out.  I think for everything related to the W7 it would be like $1500 or something.  That's not including prep.

He is really trying to learn all that he can and stay on top of these things with estimated payments and check ins. He had some sticker shock with Q1 so i walked him through how i calculated the numbers. it all made sense to him and the large SE tax is influencing his desire to switch to S-Corp this year. He is going to pay 1/2 of my calculated numbers since he doesn't have a lot in the business account and we figure the tax will decrease with s-corp switch and I told him we can always make up for it in Q2/Q3/Q4 as we go if things start to rapidly increase. he also moved from Utah to Montana so thats a change. He is also going to spending a lot of time overseas this year.

He asked about retirement options - i told him theres a self employeed retirement option for him since hes self employed and told him mark is the expert there and has set them up before so he is going to schedule a meeting w/ mark to discuss those options. He had a question too on quickbooks and having an investment/trading account for the company and he wanted to know how to get that to work within quickbooks so i said I'd connect him with Andrew for help on that.

he is definitely someone who will be growing with us and we will continue to have more services to offer him.

I'm asking this because our Financial Planning client, Cary Jacobson, has about $1k a month to invest and he wants to start diversifying and getting into the market.  I think it's a perfect time to start to DCA into the market.  

Talked through the portfolio I built (""Dat's Picks"" in Altruist) which is basically my brokerage account but modified to be a little heavier in SPY (S&P 500) and Bonds/Muni's.  

He said one of the funds that's a staple for him lately is the Fidelity Blue Chip Growth ETF cause it has all the 'Magnificent Seven' tech stocks (Meta, Apple, nVidia, etc.) and the fees are super low on it.  It's also an ETF so a lot safer.  Swapped out the Vanguard Large Cap ETF for that one and also lowered the allocations for the M7 stocks.  

Tristan is a ""Money Manager"" which is under the wealth management umbrella like Mark but as a CFP, the focus is on planning and long term plans vs Money Managers are people who manage Brokerage Accounts for High Net Worth Individuals.

"Apr 7, 2025",Prospect/Client,No,,,,,,,,,,No Work Item Needed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Cary Jacobson's 1040 will need to be SUPERCEDED.  I talked to him on Sunday 4/6 about some personal financial planning as well as the Back Door ROTH for 2024 and 2025.  He's got a 19% tax bracket right now and due for a promotion (as well as his income trending upwards for 2025 but still relatively low) so I think this super makes sense for him.  

We went through his current 401k withholdings, his budget from a Cash Flow / Total Income perspective.  He's paid quarterly commissions which makes up a bulk of his income so a little more involved of a budgeting exercise than a typical W2.  He also had about $140k in a savings account so he's looking to see how to allocate that.  He's just starting to see his income jump so he wants to make sure he's doing all the right things.  

For him, he's a ""Single, High W2"" and starting to diversify with things like a home purchase in 2024.  The Backdoor ROTH will look a lot better in a few years when he's in the 30% tax bracket and he has a Post Tax Asset in his portfolio that was taxed at 19%.  He transferred $14k from his Wells Fargo Savings to his Altruist MM account in order to make Non Deductible IRA contributions of $7k for 2024 and $7k for 2025.  I think Mark has to do this and also get compliance stuff if we're going to invest it into anything.  

He also transferred another $40k into the Money Market cause it earns a lot more than his WF Savings account but he really wants to start dripping that into the market.  I told him it's a good position to be in for entering the market but I'm loyal to the ""Dollar Cost Average"" principle and talked him through some of the vanilla funds I'm in (Basically Mutual Funds and ETFs that are tied to S&P, Crypto (XRP), and Rates/Commodities as a hedge.  I'm sure there has to be a risk profile for the brokerage as well.  I'll talk to him tonight about starting to get some recurring trades going but think he's looking to invest around $1k per month into the market.  In 2-3 years.. that's going to look soooooooo much better.  

He's going to move forward with Life Insurance that Gaye (His aunt and our FA partner kind of) had presented him a $1k per month WL policy which I thought made sense.  Decently aggressive but he can afford it and think that it's similar to the ROTH where this will create another Tax-Friendly Asset in his portfolio to make him more flexible in a few years.  I said he should just do a Annual Pay because he usually has a good buffer in his savings from his quarterly commission checks but his Paycheck is only on his base so doing Annual Pay will help from a monthly cash flow perspective.  

He did ask if the Altruist MM would be able to pay bills.  I checked briefly and I don't think it can but Mark might know something that I don't.  

From a tax prep standpoint, we just need to supercede the return and add the [1] Contribution to IRA (Non-Deductible) [2] Distribution / Rollover into a ROTH IRA.  Basically on the 1040 it should say IRA Distributions on the front of the 1040 for $7k but the Taxable Amount should be $0.  

I think it makes sense for Mark to take the reigns on this one for compliance reasons.  I know there's a lot of documentation necessary so think safer to have the CFP do it.",https://app2.karbonhq.com/4mTyp9lLRWTC#/work/25l4HgPXrC35,,,,,

He has already gotten his taxes prepped but saw a big number so needed a second opinion of sorts.  Didn't see any numbers so kind of just gave him a high level overview of what might have happened.  I need some more work done on my backyard so hopefully getting some discounted services out of it and a LOMAR prospect in 2025.  Not a ton of upside but call it a 6th round pick that can turn into a 5th.  

He's retired and got about $100k of earned income between SS, IRAs, Pensions, etc. but they also sold about $400k of stocks this year where he said he withheld about $80k (~20% cap gains).  He thought that was enough but his CPA is saying he owes another $30k.  My first thought was that the CPA missed ST vs LT but feel like if he got another $400k of income that his tax bill would look a lot larger than that.  My guess is that the $400k moved him up a few tax brackets thus his withholdings on the other stuff was too low so the tax bill is driven on that.  It makes sense, $100k and going from the 12% to 32% or 35% bracket will hit you quick.  Should have talked to an accountant beforehand.. 

Gave him my email and said we'd take a look once he gets the return back from the CPA and he said he'd come to us next year but we'll see about that.

"Apr 5, 2025",Prospect/Client,No,,,,,,,,,,No Work Item Needed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Talked to David & Amira for about an hour to sort through all of his taxes.  ALFRED said that it would be unlikely that he would get equity for $0 but that's exactly what happened because he was one of the early founders of BodyArmor.  He has received K1's from them until 2021 when they were acquired by Coca Cola.  He said at the time they specifically told him to get a CPA because this was not a straightforward situation which he tried to do but the guy was ass.  

He's not the most organized person in the world so I'm not sure that the CPA understood that David was an owner of BodyArmor not an employee with stock comp.  He sent us all of those documents (like.. ALL of the documents including the sale agreement between Coca Cola & Body Armor) and I prepped it on Friday.  

David also had a CPA tell him to buy an Escalade for Highlite Media Group LLC (which I guess he started in like 2017 or something) when Coke bought BA but then he got a new Financial Advisor who was also a tax prepper and the person didn't let him write it off because it wasn't registered in the business and he also said the expenses were too high for so little income because he also has a W2 income (even then he was technically self employed because it was essentially SE with W2 salary).  If you know David you will know why this next part is entertaining but he was SUPER upset because he bought the Escalade literally on 12/31 so that he can get the tax break for it (Coke bought BA in November) and they didn't have the trim and sound system he wanted LOL.  David always wants the top best of everything and annoyed that this Escalade didn't have a Sun Roof and stuff like that.  Side note, that CPA was also wrong because he actually needed a vehicle over 6k pounds to carry DJ equipment around and he was doing higher class events which would deem it ""Ordinary and necessary"" for the business.  Just bad CPA advice all around.  

I redid the return and he's probably getting about $30 - $40k back.  I'm not sure if I did the amendment correctly so Caroline to review what I prepped for 2021.  The only thing to note is that I played around with moving Highlite into an SCorp which would help with taxes but other considerations make it not worth it.  After 2021, we'll definitely amend 2022 and 2023.. which probably should be done before we file 2024.  

Once he heard about the refund he was activity engaged and was firing back documents rapidly.  Amira also said she was waiting to the call with me and blocked off this weekend for taxes cause she knew she'd have homework so think I've seen them get docs over this weekend.  

Amira was also on the call (also forwarding me his documents as I was asking or them because whenever he gets anything important he forwards it to her and she organizes it for him LOL) and said she's talked to Caroline/Andrew over the past few weeks and she's a big fan of both of them and appreciates them for helping to sort out both of their messes.  David also texted me ""We're team Motta!"" 

I think they might become an advisory client which would be insanely clutch because David is probably the most well connected man I know (and that's saying a lot) so think this could rapidly get Motta into some nice circles.  He will also most likely move this assets over.  I think I saw he was paying ~$5k a quarter in fees or something and he was getting a ton of dividend income which I don't know makes sense for someone at a 35% tax bracket but I'll defer to Dwyer on that one.  

We're building a brand and we're getting that brand into some pretty cool circles quickly folks! I'll send him a proposal for the amendments too.  He's getting like $30 racks back so he'll probably pay whatever.",https://app2.karbonhq.com/4mTyp9lLRWTC#/work/2DjpSxXvJRMT/details,,,,,

He was like 4 years younger than me but he was one of my early Padawans.  

He's Mormon so he went to BYU and just stayed out there.  He has worked in Product Management in SaaS his whole career and a couple of his close friends at BYU started a SaaS platform that helps sales type companies who buy leads.  Essentially when you get a lead, they send an automated video to introduce the person which they've found to help the customer close clients.  For us, I can see us using this for after they schedule a meeting on Calendly to get a video of who we are and our client onboarding process so they are more prepared for the meeting.  

He said they just hit $1 million of ARR (Annual Recurring Revenue) which he said isn't much but they are proud of it.  A lot of their clients love their software but are looking for a full on CRM.  They are working non stop to build out their platform to a full CRM but I think it's still in development.  He says they've found that this software is super useful in the financial advisory space along with some tax practitioners.  He says it integrates with some of the ""RIA approved"" CRM platforms such as Wealthbot or Redtail.  

From a tax standpoint, I talked through our process and he says he used 2 different people over the past two years.  The first one he made an appointment and went into an office which he said was a sliver helpful but this year it was all through email and he got nothing out of it.  He said he just filed otherwise he would have went with Motta.  He says for sure for 2025 so I'll gather his documents now to queue us up for it.  He also says he wants to do some tax planning and says he doesn't really have a lot of money but said he'd move his funds over to us (although he says he doesn't have a lot so asked if he had minimums).  He'll be a tax prep client for 2025 taxes but potentially a Wealth Mgmt client in 2024.

I strongly suggested he open a bank account for it so there's less poop to clean up and to put it in an LLC as well (especially because it's subsidized housing) and he agreed.  

Luckily I created a QBO account for Chris already and got the accounts synced up so the plan (for Andrew) is to turn the Christopher Martin QBO account into the ""E 27th Street LLC"" account for the rental property.  I started to create a COA for that one but I know P24 has built a rental COA for my personal rental before so think they can set this one up.  

This will be: 

(1) LLC Entity Formation for SMLLC
(2) QBO Set Up
(3) Quarterly Bookkeeping ($149 a quarter) 

Do QBO at 50% off (I basically already did it with tax prep so this is kind of what we pitch to clients) and LLC Formation at 15% off for his loyalty but Chris Martin says he appreciates the discounts provided but said we're elite and he'd be lost without us so he wants to pay us.  That's actually how this project came about, he goes ""Can I pay you for something? What's the next important thing I need to get done, let's do that"".

He made $32k in W2 wages last year and we talked through the Pro's / Con's of extending his taxes in order to save on student loan repayments.  I told him there's a risk to doing that and at $32k, I don't think it's moving the needle too much.  

Game plan is to prep the return and he can see if he wants to extend or not based on what the student loan repayments look like.

They have a rental partnerhship Sugar Shores LLC for a property on panana beach florida. It is listed a Condotel, which causes a bunch of issues with the mortgage company and lot of banks wont lend to you because they view them as high rish properties consisting of all people who dont actually live in them, higher risk for defaults.  Even if you have good credit, if you own a condotel and there is a string of defaults in the building could have a big impact on the HOA ect. 

Talked about the rental property for a while, is it worth maintaining the llc, her dad had suggested just buying liability insurance and getting rid of the LLC. We advised keeping the partnership and LLC in place for added protection. They currently have the property listed for sale, have been having trouble renting it in 2025, so for the right price might sell, if not they want to refinance in the fall. Currently have  8%mortgage rate.

They have not filed the partnership return, so late with that and they need their 1040 done as well.  They have used turbo tax in the past but would prefer if we just handled both this year. Dat mentioned financial planning, they would be interested in discussing that after tax season, they recently bought some life insurance and were unsure if they were getting good advice or just being sold.

I didn't realize how much shit was there.  (Barn) His barn is massive and he's putting solar panels on that thing.  I told him about our network but he had already got 3 quotes on them.  I told him about the benefits and tax credits on panels which will help for 2025.  He has to build some sort of thing for it but he said it'll take him a long weekend to do.  I said to make sure he's tracking hours / costs on that project.   (Rental) This was way nicer than I thought it was gonna be.  It's big but only a 1 bedroom, 1 bath, and a kitchenette... it also has a full 3 car garage? Either way, he built all of this stuff himself which is pretty impressive. 

His wife (who I think is way younger than him and also not sure what she does but she seems to come from money because he keeps talking about  how his father in law helped him build everything and probably built $15m worth of property on the lake they live on.  He has done custom homes for like 30 years) also wants to add this 2 story addition type thing to the rental or something.  It's gonna be attached to the house and shaped like an octagon and the way it seemed, his life was looking to build an irl princess tower.  He also has a W2 job and cooks / puts the kids to bed.  It seems like she just asks him to build things and he has the specific skill set in order to do so.  These are tax deductions as well so wins all around except for his free time. 

He also said he got a letter from the IRS for 2022 for $10k in gambling winnings.  He also said he paid his 2023 tax bill.  The man just seemed defeated and didn't want to dig up the expenses because he know he didn't do a good job of it.  He said he wants to pay it off and just get on the right path going forward.  He said these discussions have been super super insightful and when he talked to his old CPA and asked how he can itemize deductions she literally said ""find more than $27k of deductions to get over the standard deductions"".. she's technically not wrong.  He says he understands this a lot more and this is exactly what he needed.  He was spending all this money and doing all of this stuff aimlessly so he just needed someone to provide a little financial literally.  

He also said he wanted to put everything into an LLC so I said he should definitely do that.  I also talked to him about having the LLCs be put into a trust so that the beneficiaries can get the Step Up basis on the assets.  

REAL ESTATE GENIUS: If you have an investment property and depreciate it down to $0 than you've taken all the tax benefits from it then get hit with depreciation recapture.  Maybe if you're a loser.  Then you say 1031 exchange.  Doesn't fit a lot of the times and buying a new property is contingent upon market.  That's like your run of the mill CPA answer.  If you put that into a revocable trust, the assets will get step up basis and your beneficiaries get it at FMV.  So depreciate it down to $0, die, then no one pays taxes.

I said he needs to ""start doing rich guy stuff"" like buy expensive shit and do drugs like a true Wall Street guy but he responded by saying ""Yeah dude, we gotta make sure I'm putting it in the right places"".  Way too modest for me but Dwyer probably loves it from an AUM perspective.

Bright kid and super diligent.  He started his own SMLLC as an independent contractor for his tattoo work but also just opened up a tattoo shop which officially opened in 2025.  He says for his personal LLC, he tracks all of his expenses/miles/etc. on excel but has it's own bank account and he seems very organized.  Also keeps biz/personal funds separate so hopefully not a lot of poop.  

He said there were a lot of expenses to build the shop in 2024 that were all paid out of his LLC account and he was wondering if that was okay.  I said that's actually ideal because that's basically his LLC (him) contributing to the Tattoo Shop and the LLC should own the shop anyways so the numbers are already clean.  He also has a partner who also has their own SMLLC and has their own accountant.  They split everything 50/50.  

They have a bank account and says they don't have any expenses yet cause they just opened.  I talked him through doing a QBO set up for his own LLC and the business books and the benefits of that.  He was blown away about being able to sync the bank account with QBO cause he usually takes his bank statements and punches the transactions into excel.  Told him about the automation aspects of it and he really resonated with that.  He wants to keep it automated so that he can focus on other things.  

I used the rizz of ""Why pay for Tax Prep, which is a compliance expense, when you can pay for us to set up your QBO.  Now you've just invested in your business infrastructure instead of paying tax prep fees"".  On our side, getting clients from excel to QBO makes Tax Prep sooo easy going forward so basically charge them the same for the tax prep fees and makes our job a little harder now but way less work going forward.  

He also needed the BOI filing ASAP.  We would need his biz info (EIN, address, etc.) and the owner's drivers licenses.  He'll need it for the Tattoo Shop and for his personal LLC.  

I'll send out the requests now so that we can get this going.   Brian O can price this one but it'll be a QBO Set Up (you did this with OCP for your other boy BP) & BOI filing for both entities then SCorp Prep & 1040C prep for 2024.",https://app2.karbonhq.com/4mTyp9lLRWTC#/work/25RnCw4MCYms,,,,,

He said it was ""extraordinary"" and tbh.. the only real difference was that we were diligent about getting all of their expenses.

We'll continue to work through the 2022 return finalization but alternatively he can to get the returns filed for 2024 (they need 2 years of returns).  

We talked through both and that he had a $60k tax bill.  Talked to him for awhile about that and the conclusion is that he's getting into too many JVs that require upfront cash but they won't see revenue for a quarter after they are ramped up and close on their next sales cycle.  He is also moving their business to basically only sell United Wholesale Mortgage product because he makes 40 basis points off those deals.  Changing to that product was in Dec / Jan.  In conjunction with the new JVs ramping up (along with the sales people having a big Feb so slacking off in March) is causing lumpiness in revenue.  

On top of all of that, he's looking to maximize the valuation of 3PM in hopes of selling it.  He's the sole owner of 3PM and it netted $277k of income + $65k of depreciation recapture from his car.  So he gets why the tax bill is happening and why he makes $350k of taxable income but feels broke.  

He understands all of this and said he'll do a review of the Biz Returns and get those filed.  Also said his wife will get over the rest of the info when he's back at the house.  

I told him I had class tonight so he understands.  Be ready to file the 3PM biz return and to wrap up the indy.  

Brian - I don't think we ever sent a proposal for the tax prep.  Get the prep to like $750 and $89 for his personal.

He has down his own taxes and seems to feel good about doing the,.  Said he just has a W2 and some fidelity statements asked what i thought about people doing their own taxes.  I said it can make sense for smaller clients with W2 but not for people with 50k tax bills and he laughed about that agreed with me. 

He mentioned he messed up sold some RSU that were short term gains and know he should of focused on the long term gains. I explained to him the difference from a tax stand point and that is something that we could definitely help out with. 

He asked about pricing, I went over base tax prep fees and suggest a stock analysis plan we usually charge around $1500. I emphasized this is all flexible and based on what exactly he is looking for. 

i asked if he does tax estimates or anything and he said he just lives the dark on that stuff. So again opportunity for planning their, so he doesnt have 50k tax bill everyyear.

She has dissolved Shade & Travel as an entity in May of 2024 (she still actually runs the business which is concerning given the nature of the business).  

She had a partner but it seems like they had a falling out so they dissolved it but they have an excel spreadsheet of all the income / expenses they've had since the inception of the company.  

This is basically a nothing business but the upside here is that she was thinking of incorporating ""Career Workshops & Business Seminars"" into her trips because there are often a lot of business owners and entrepreneurs on these trips.  She was thinking Motta might be able to join the trip (as a vendor) for to put on these seminars and potentially network with some of these clients.  

We also talked about how there are a lot of influencers / content creators at Motta and if we'd specialize.  She was in marketing and seems to have a good feel for this kind of stuff.  I came to the realization that Vegas might not be our biggest markets because the market is different than other cities.  There aren't a ton of corporations out here so the only ""clients"" aside from small businesses out here are more ""Entertainment"" type clients such as influencers, content creators, etc.  

Came to the realization is that depending on what city we're in, we have to target our client approach on what the market has to offer.  For example, we're gonna get a lot of farm clients in the midwestern part of the country.. we should be targeting our efforts into getting into farming networks.  In Vegas, it's content creators and other solo type SMLLCs / SCorps.  

Where I don't think these are going to be incredibly lucrative clients (although some influencers make a couple hundred thousand a year and I hear OnlyFans models are paid better than NBA players) but it could be a way to get our brand exposure out there via the influencer channel.  

I'm going to help her with the final returns for these bad boys and she is also a flight attendant with JSX (a semi private airline) so I'm doing an exchange of services for this one.",https://app2.karbonhq.com/4mTyp9lLRWTC#/work/39LDsWCnv7NH,,,,,

He is the ""High Income, Single Filer, no Assets, gets Equity"".  He makes about $185k a year and gets quarterly grants.  I don't think he gets a life changing amount of grants but still a good chunk from what I gather.  

He used to get his taxes done by a family friend who is a CFP.  He's a typical prepper and he said his fees keep going up, which is fine, but his issue is that his tax situation has gotten significantly more complicated but he's gotten no additional questions or suggestions on what taxes are even.  

He had no idea what the difference between tax prepping and tax advising.  Talked him through that and also example of some of the tax advising clients we have.  I said if he wanted us to do (1) Tax Prep (2) Tax Plan (3) Bi Annual Tax Planning Meetings that it would be $1750 with the tax plan being a 1 time cost and the Tax Prep / Bi Annual meetings would be recurring.  He was very open to it but ultimately started with just the tax prep. I think this is a situation where since we already do more ""Advising"" than tax prep, he isn't sure if that will be sufficient for him or if he'll need a full on plan.  I think he'll come on board, he seems to know nothing about all of this and his tax situation is already more complex because of his equity grants.

I was coming from the gym and mis timed the meeting so I was in a sweaty hoody. Dave called me after the meeting and told me that Dan is a VC basically and has made $20+ million dollars on two company exits.  Dave says he's also swung and missed a couple of times but that's the nature of the beast.  Dave says Dan LOVES us and even talked about how he had an accountant for 15 years and referred him hundreds of thousands of dollars in referrals but fired him because he was unresponsive. He has a new accountant for all of 3 years and already hates them.  I think we could potentially win his business soon.  

Dave says Dan LOVES us (despite my attire but I think that added to my charm) and was really really excited about the potential of this thing.  Dave says Dan has told him for years he's doing this consulting thing but it's professional services so you can't sell it for a gigantic multiple so he has been looking for a ""home run"" that has a potential for a $100 million dollar exit and he thinks that ALFRED has that potential.  

We talked about all the different applications of it but at the end of the day we need to build it. I'm meeting with David Hischfeld tomorrow to start to build the platform but he's more the front end guy vs I think Dimitri is more of a back end developer.  

Overall this is an exciting meeting to see a VC see that potential in us.  He works with Parthenon (spelling) which is a portfolio of 7-10 large firms which Dave estimates their total clients to be around 400k.

We met him through Suffolk.  He doesn't actually work for Suffolk and has spent his career in the Software Dev industry and really has dove into the world of Ai.  He is the ""Head of Ai"" at Suffolk as it is one of the biggest parts of their strategic plan.  He does workshops and helps Suffolk build the Ai curriculum.  

We talked about AQ for SEED purposes but also from a Motta perspective.  We talked about AQ on the huddle but it's essentially a platform that combines a bunch of Ai models (ChatGPT, Gemini, etc.) onto one platform that is on a private server.  ChatGPT is open so all the information we put into it is in OpenAi's ether.  With AQ, we can plug it into our software and create a private Ai platform that is directly connected to all of our client info and platforms.. while also being able to access the IRS tax code.  

When Dimitri demonstrated the tool at the BXC Seminar, he created an ""Agent"" that would do research on a company/person, then an agent to aggregate the data and sort for relevance for our specific firm and specific services, summarize into an automated report, generates an intro email based on extensive research including how we can specifically help the client.  

Dimitri says he implements AQ with ""Use cases"" so he asked us for an example of a client so we can build the platform and he'll show us how.  I think we use this for: 

(1) Skellig: Research on the client (like the example above) along with pricing maybe.  

(2) WM Referral from Trevor: I saw that AQ has Wealth Management Applications so maybe we see if Dimitri can link this to Right Capital.  Dimitri is also interested in Partnering with firms like ourselves to build and license these platforms to other firms.  This is perfect timing because we met with DeCelle earlier in the morning and Dave says he has a GINORMOUS market of firms that he'd deploy ALFRED on.  

(3) Any new Indy: Maybe a HIMAR prospect coming in the pipeline but want to use an example that is typical for us.  

Dimitri expressed high interest in collaborating on a platform.  I think with our engine (Motta tax engine) and our distribution team (Model FA), I think we can provide all things Dimitri is looking for as far as building a SAAS platform for consulting firms.  

Mark and Me to run point on this but I'd like Brian O to be involved in the beginning because we are using AQ as a client research tool to start.

The answer is going to the Matthew.  I talked to them about some of the items we were missing and I believe they sent it while we were on the call.  It was essentially just mileage for him.  They are new at being self employed so I talked them through the direct method for Home Office and Vehicles but they didn't seem to get it. 

Action items are for someone (Prep crew) to incorporate the last pieces of info they sent over and finalize the return.  Most likely Matthew will take all the deductions as he is in a significantly higher bracket.

Referral from Paige Borchers who are co-workers at my barbershop.  I think having a female barber demonstrates that I'm a #feminist

Victoria is super nice but super anxious/nervous about all of this because she is a new business owner.  Along with the barber job, she has a W2 job as a bartender on the weekends and also an SMLLC as a Content Creator. I wasn't sure what she was creating exactly as she danced around that so curious to see where the 1099s come in from.  She said she made about $10k from that last year. 

She's from Ohio originally but lived in Los Angeles for about 3 years.  She's been in Vegas for about a year and a half and loves it here.  She also said if Paige is ever out and I need a haircut it would be.. on the house.  

She did say she's struggling a bit financially (which is why she picked up the barber job) so asked if we can spread whatever fee we are charging across a few months.  I'm very okay with that, especially to help out new entrepreneurs.  

She also said she uses ZenBusiness for her registered agent service and she's up for renewal for $200 per year.  I said I would be able to do it for less.  

For the proposal: 

1040_C (no state since NV): $450

His Electrician business 4x in 2024 but he just started it in 2023 and only made like $5k or something.  I remember him saying he spent a majority of the first year sending quotes out so cool to see that they panned out.  

He said he's starting to get bigger jobs too so he asked about if we knew anyone who does business insurance.  He got insurance via Next on his phone but he's starting to do bigger Cannabis jobs that use Carbon or something which could kill someone so he wants to make sure he's covered.  His insurance is just for electrical work so he wants to make sure they wouldn't disqualify it since he's doing more specialized work.  

The dude is super diligent, he tracks everything to the tee and already has his business in an LLC (which I'm not sure I knew).  Also keeps all his funds separate and said he knows not to comingle funds.  

From a tax standpoint, he walked through all of his excel files which he has organized by expense type (he showed his vehicle expenses with all the costs in excel) so I think this will be an easier Schedule C.  I told him about QuickBooks online and the advantages there.  He said that would be super helpful because he spends 4-5 hours every quarter just tracking all of his receipts and stuff.  I remember asking Sweeney to tell him about QB Ledger in the fall but the man wasn't big on throwing the spear.  He could potentially be a very small bookkeeping client (thinking $100 a quarter and discounted set up cause he's a super nice dude).  He's looking to do this full time by 2026 so could be a good foot in the door.  

I also forgot that he asked Sweeney about financial planning and said he knows he still has to get his stuff organized and talk to Mark.  I think it's even more critical now if he's looking to become an entrepreneur.  He also said he was in a scramble drill getting 1099s out but he figured it out.  He had reached out to us on a Friday and we didn't get back to him on a Monday.  He said it was completely on him and doesn't blame us at all for not getting back to him.  

I asked Mark to drop from the call because I forgot that this probably fits better with him even the Financial Planning element.  His meeting title was ""Proposal Discussion"" but the only thing he was wondering was if it was just for him because he's MFJ with his wife (like last year).  He said he'll sign the proposal and send us all his tracking docs.  

Mark to handle this one, I'm not sure if we have any business insurance contacts for CO but I said I'd check to see if we had anyone, Taxes should be relatively straightforward, and then after they are filed, follow up and find some time to talk through financial planning and also bookkeeping.",https://app2.karbonhq.com/4mTyp9lLRWTC#/work/2lDlSBlbnZZD,,,,,

When he was starting Elmira, he hadn't opened the LLC or had a business account so all the funds to both buy and fix up the property was scattered across 2 credit cards and 3 bank accounts. We had originally synced his personal accounts to the Elmira QBO to get all the start up costs related to the property but I never got a chance to talk him through it. To add another wrinkle, he has another multi unit property (E 27th street). So it's 2 properties, 4 units, and scattered across about 5-6 bank accounts / credit cards. He admits it's not the most straight forward. 

Also note that their business credit card (BoFa) is similar to ours where the business card is under Rickey and there's also a clone of the card. So Elmira should have a biz checking and 2 biz credit cards. I labeled them in the system and also added descriptions to QB accounts. 

We went through the accounts on the Elmira and properly label them instead of the default names. He also sent a Google Doc with all of his start up costs by Bank/CC account. The plan is to reconcile those expenses with his personal accounts on Elmira then he's going to sync them with the QB Ledger Account to track his Biz expenses on his personal card and to track expenses for E 27th street. His properties are not cash flow positive yet so the moving between accounts is going to happen over the next year so having a QBO for Chris Martin the person makes sense to track all those expenses. 

I'll handle this one cause Elmira has been lingering for a long time and also still need to notarize their operating agreement.

He said he checked the previous two years and it's been consistently $200 over the previous year so we can use that as a basis but I'd rather him try to get the form. 

I pitched him on a bookkeeping engagement so that he doesn't have to spend all that time doing the receipts and stuff.  Pretty small business and pretty low activity so thinking $99 per month.

We also only talked for like 20 minutes but not in a bad way.. just was on the same page and efficient.  

His intake said he had a terrible CPA experience so read that but he actually already got all of that taken care of which he hated a lot.  He had to redo all his 2023 business and personal taxes and think he said he got all the state filings done as well.  

He was super receptive but also skeptical due to past experiences with CPAs so don't think he's ready to throw over the keys to his bookkeeping... yet.  We talked about pricing and said for 2 SCorps would be around $2,500 and we would include the Tax Assessment / Individual 1040 complimentary.  

He said Maslyn (SCorp #1 located in Cali) is where all the activity is located.  He also said he wants to move the business to a different state due to the state taxes & compliance.  It's a very tedious process but Caroline & I talked about this with Melon who moved from Cali -> Nevada.  

Infin8Energy has no activity at all.. although I thought he said he didn't file anything for that SCorp which concerns me.  

The smaller one will be easy so let's do $1,999 for 2 S-Corps, Tax Review / Assessment, and Individual 1040 (with all states as well).  Think if we land this, he'll sign for the Advisory Work as well as Bookkeeping.",https://app2.karbonhq.com/4mTyp9lLRWTC#/work/281s3tNkLDx3,,,,,

We talked about our bookkeeping process and our process to ""Automate & Optimize"" company books. Then demonstrated how much faster we can do returns because of our infrastructure and screen shared as I walked through the QBO -> ProConnect upload.  He was pretty blown away. 

He is a CFP/EA but doesn't know anything about QBO and/or Accounting.  He doesn't even seem like he likes taxes that much.  His Partner / CoFounder is a CFP / CPA but also more on the CFP side of the house.  

He seemed super into White Labeling our services which means we would have no contact with the client (he said the RE client specifically only wants to talk to Amir) and he would charge them our fees plus a mark up.  He is strictly a fee based Financial Planner so he can't do a Rev Share because he can't earn variable income. I remember reading about this when I was doing ALFRED research on partnering with her Financial Advisors.  

We went over time because he has a handful of clients he'd like to WL our services for. Dwyer was taking notes on the numbers and we still have the details from the recording. 

1. The Real Estate client that DeCelle told us about.  Dave said the guy was paying $90k and Amir said $70k so I think Amir was low balling us to make some margins.  Could be do-able for me instead of a Rev Share.  Basically we charge less instead of paying him (Dwyer, this is what he meant by Gusto).  

He said the client has A LOT ($90k worth) of Real Estate Syndicates.  Basically they find big RE projects and then find investors so it could be a $1.5 m strip mall with a group of 20 partners.  The actual bookkeeping will be generally straightforward but the K1 distributions are where they struggle.  That's where the QBO -> ProConnect would be huge.  He uses CCH right now and says it's terrible.  I talked to him about farming out the Tax Prep as well which he seemed open to.  

2.  He has a client with a giant perfume company and they also got a bunch of tax noise because they cashed in a Perm Life Insurance Policy for a million dollars and forgot to report it then their old accountant was on QB Desktop and wouldn't give them their books.  He said fortunately the million dollars was below the threshold for Tax Evasion because the guy is really rich so he was okay ish but another example of terrible previous accountants.  

He also said the son of this perfume tycoon is also trying to start a perfume business or something.  

3.  He said his wife's friend sells Jewelry but basically makes no money on it.  He basically offered to be her account as his FGA in QBO because he's definitely not an accountant.  

I think he sees the value in this relationship and next steps would be for Mark to send him our fee schedules and provide our calendar links.  We also talked to him about our flexibility in pricing because of how efficient we are.

She claims she never received the year end numbers but pretty sure we did so think she realized she missed an email.  We went through the numbers in detail and she suspects we might be missing some of her initial expenses which he kept via excel.  By the tone of her email (which I tagged to the work items) she said ""I understand you're only as good as the information I give you"" so think she understands there was balls dropped on her side as well.  It was a good conversation.  

Talked through her tax return as well and some of the loss limitation rules as well as her capital loss rules.  We talked through potential payroll, profitability, and other avenues such as SEP plans as retirement vehicles for her.  

Drew gets a lot of equity grants so their W2 income in super high but the actual investments are below what he got them for so basically he gets taxed as ordinary income when the company grants him the equity (or when they vest) but when he cashes them in for a $240k loss, he can only take $3,000 of his income on his tax return.  They still make A TON of money so I don't really feel bad for them but it's still not fun. 

Parlay'd the conversation into a Real Estate conversation and also maxing out Drew's 401k as a tax savings strategy cause they are in the 37% tax bracket so not allowed to do a lot.  She said her financial advisor said no and to let him take the money and invest it.  She says he was in the same cohort as Drew in college and they are friends but she thinks he's kind of an A hole and a Wall Street Finance Bro.  He told them not to invest in their house but she says it's literally sinking into the river.  Could be a MWM lead.  

She wanted us to reconcile the pre - opening expenses (which AG has) but think her tax return is pretty much complete.

He was asking for Tax / Personal Finance advice but asked if I knew any CPAs to refer him to because he wasn't sure if he was big enough to help and because he didn't want to be a burden.  I said I'd 100% take care of him but he insisted if we do that than he'd be a paying customer.  

He works for Shell in a new service line for them. He is an engineer that is helping to build Shell's program to make fleets of 18 wheelers all electric.  He makes about $187k a year and should crack $200k in 2025.  He falls into the ""High Income, Single Filer, Standard Deduction"".  He's also a big Crypto guy.  

He got a 1099-R because he did a backdoor ROTH conversation.   I explained he couldn't do a regular one because due to high income.  I said it probably makes sense to go Pre-Tax vs Roth and max out his 401k but also said that I'm always on the side of diversification so if he has the money to pay the extra taxes now, the benefit is that now he has a bigger ""Post Tax"" account that will continue to grow.  Smart move, just a bigger tax bill in the short term.  

He seemed to say he had most of his taxes done already so he might be a 2025 client but we'll gather the docs and get him set up either way.  

For proposal, let's get him at $149 for total proposal, he should be an indy for the most part.  Didn't sell any Crypto this year",https://app2.karbonhq.com/4mTyp9lLRWTC#/work/2VBylqtV5m1P,,,,,

He said after Cam had talked to us, he called Davis excited like a kid in a candy store.  

Super good dude and very similar to Cam from a vibes standpoint except with a southern accent.  He was an engineer out of college and worked behind a desk in a windowless room which he hated.  Started working part time with Cam and was much happier to left and now working with Cam full time.  From what I gather, Cam is grooming him to take over the contracting while he moves over to his Motorsports passion.  

He said he went to H&R block last year and paid around $425 (base was $350 then ended up at $425 after fees) and said he had QBO but they instead gave him a form which was basically a Schedule C and asked him to write down his total numbers.  Then they disallowed a bunch of stuff because they didn't feel like he had sufficient documentation (which he admits he didn't).  He hated that experience overall but still said everyone was super nice.  He said he was basically a newer Prepper then their ""Supervisor"", who was supposed to be the expert, was also a trainee.  Not great. 

We went through pricing and I said baseline would be $450 and Sch C on top of that but we have a discount relationship with Renegade so I said it would be roughly the same price he paid at H&R with all the discounts included but he'll be getting much better quality.

Agreed to do her taxes for $500, that is what she paid last year. She is a good friends cousin and trying to figure out how to run her business.

She wants to meet in may for planning. She needs help getting a SBA loan potentially and will needs the financials and business plan cleaned up. She wants to secure a new space, when her lease is up in october. Looking for a bigger space with multiple chairs so she can rent the others out and diversify her income streams so its not just her busting her ass on her feet, she has another way to make money.

She said her stuff is pretty easy so she doesn't know if she'll need a CPA going forward (think she will with the Ross relationship) but she also said she started talking to Ross for planning when she was planning to buy a house but then just bought a house.  So they started talking about financial planning now and she said she wanted to get her taxes done first before she did planning because she's worried she was gonna owe.  So think if we can execute, it'll help Ross close so this is a good opportunity for us.

On the bookkeeping side, we created Monthly Reports and noted that the accounts were a bit jumbled and also he has a lot of contractor payments but no Payroll set up.  Definitely think he should be doing that with $400k top line and $233 net.  No surprise why he's getting demolished on income taxes. Proposed Bookkeeping & Payroll services to Cam which he already signed.  

AG already started moving expenses around and also noticed he has a bunch of contractors that would require 1099s.  We're talking to him tomorrow so if he does need them, we can do them quick.  I'd even comp this out of goodwill.  Good catch by AG and also beating me to moving some of the accounts to COGs.

From a tax standpoint, he has 2 Schedule C's for his business on his 2023 1040.  He told us he tried to do it himself and submitted it and he thought he got some sort of error message.. that's probably why.  He should file as an SCorp anyways so if we can get it done by 3/15 I think we can file the 2553 with the return.  We'll need it to be an SCorp so sent the proposal for Tax Services / Restructuring as well.  Built in room for the absolute nightmare of a mess I imagine this job being.  

Cam is super attentive and scheduled a meeting tomorrow (2.28) to talk through.  He seems like he wants to do it the right way and just wants guidance.

Jared actually called me yesterday as well and said that he said we were gonna charge him anywhere from $2,500 to $4,000 for Tax Prep and asked if that was within our range which I said was fine.  He said Cam said ""Yeah I'm paying that already and the people don't do anything"".  I'll confirm with Jared that it's just for tax prep but let's go with that assumption. 

Cam had some pretty bad experiences with CPAs (See meeting summary & recording).  He's trying to do the right things and trying to bring in the right people to help with the business.  He has a CFO advisor type and he was the one who reached out to his uncle for an introduction for a Financial Planner which is how he met Jared.  

I'll send out follow ups and discovery documents including access to his QuickBooks account.  He said he tried to do his own return in 2023 and got rejected.  He also said he didn't think he did it correctly and duplicating things because the tax number was very high but he was like ""Eff it, I guess that's what I owe"".  He also said he didn't factor in that Virginia has high state income taxes so he still has a balance due with them.  

I think we have two scenarios 

(1) 2023 & 2024 Tax Prep for the $2,500 - $4,000.  Factor in that there will be clean up (including QBO) so I'd say on the higher end of that but we'll know more once we can see his books and discovery docs. 

(2) We can turn this into a ""Tax Advisory"" monthly fee with quarterly planning check ins, estimate calcs, and tax prep free at the end of the year.  I was thinking that would be ~$250 to $300 per month.  

Not sure what he does for Bookkeeping and I know he's going to want payroll as well so we could even parlay this into a Bookkeeping / Payroll client.  From Jared's email, the CFO doesn't seem to do anything.  He hasn't even helped him set up a payroll system.

Aside from that, he has a few friends with farms and others with businesses that he said he was going to connect us with.",https://app2.karbonhq.com/4mTyp9lLRWTC#/work/vwZMHSFhrtZ/tasks,,,,,

He has a speaker company where he will rent out his speakers for events or shows.  His speakers are in storage then he hires contractors to help him with transport, set up, break down etc.  

He is looking to legitimize a bit because there is no structure currently and nothing is being tracked.  He's the typical ""I see money coming in and coming out"". He has a QBO account but was having trouble syncing the business account.  He also has expenses scattered across Business/Person accounts (but bank accounts and credit cards).  We asked him to try to Re-Sync the bank account back to 1/1/2024 and if he's having trouble, getting an excel export from the bank website.  Also asked him to get excel exports from all of his Bank Accounts / Credit Cards and bifurcate between Biz/Personal.  

He said he needed taxes done but essentially talked him into a QBO set up in order to make his tax return easier.  We might be able to parlay this into a small bookkeeping client as well. 

He also asked about payroll but believe he's still SMLLC.  He doesn't have employees but does make contractor payments so he'll need an avenue for that and issue 1099's at the end of the year.  

From a pricing standpoint, I think we add the Accounting Onboarding and discount the tax prep.  Exact pricing TBD based on the data that comes in but thinking around $500 - $800.  Also amendable to lower if he becomes a bookkeeping client.  

Action items are to send thank yous, discovery docs, and QBO access instructions.  Also not sure if we have a request for a Business Transaction Detail to ask the clients to get excel exports for their business accounts.",https://app2.karbonhq.com/4mTyp9lLRWTC#/work/2bPyCXWslDMb,,,,,

He had questions on how to send documents as this is their first time working with a remote accountant.  I explained Karbon and how to communicate documents. 

The wife also had her identity stolen and had some issues with her state taxes, payment/refund so there is some noise there.  

He asked about pricing (although I had already sent the proposal) but I added the Schedule C and resent.  I don't think they make any money on their businesses and have a baby on the way so provided a pretty generous discount.

We were connecting the two of them, Jared is looking for an estate attorney that can partner with on his clients and had questions regarding workign with surgeons and Mal Practice Law. 

John is super down to earth and educate us on the mal practice space.  Basically all Mal Practice lawyers work for insurance companies to represent individuals against mal practice cases. Mal practice cases are very expenses thats why everybody has mal practice insurance. So there is not much to do from mal practice preparedness stand point except get insurance.

The other area John discussed is just making sure the surgeons businesses and products are all in compliance with state laws.  John recommended working with lawyers in whatever state the company is located. Potentially needing to involve IP lawyers depending on the products and companies involved. 

John covers NH, MA and FL I believe he said from an estate planning standpoint.

He has a CPA that he works with through BNI (some business networking group) who is your typical retiring tax prepper.  Todd had question's on his tax return and she couldn't explain it or didn't have time to explain it.  She wouldn't let him take costs for him cutting down trees at his rental properties as a deduction... He also has season tickets for the Bruins which he treats the same way as we treat the Celtics tickets.  He got a 1099 from Ticketmaster and I believe she gave him pushback about offsetting the income with the cost of the season tickets.  Both things I think are completely reasonable.  

He said he already paid her $500 to do her taxes but that I would take a look so I sent out document requests.  He says if we can find deductions, he's going to take it back to her and if she is even hesitant about making the changes than he'll tell her to keep the money and he'll also pay us to file his taxes but actually file them.

Went over P&L and Balance Sheet. Ruis, accountant was on the call as well. They did start to use a project based margin tracker outside of quickbooks. Their quickbooks Chart of Accts is basic, not much detail/organization. I think there is still an opportunity to redo the chart of accts and the accountant can decide whether he wants to put it in place. 

They currently have $8500, in credit card debt financed on 18months of 0% credit, said the intro rate was going to run out in a few months so trying to pay that off. Could balance transfer to another credit card but something for funding to consider when looking at options.  Think they would benefit from a line of credit. They get chunky income from several big projects through out the year and would most likely make their day to smoother and easier. 

The other thing from an accounting stand point. it wasnt really clear how they were tracking depreciation and their equipment assets. Spent 30k on new equipment last year.

Rui has big goals.  Currently looking to find a bigger studio space. The current studio is in Brockton and they are working with the city to see if there are any city owned properties with bigger space for rent opportunies but most likely will need to move the studio out of brockton. 

Anawan Studios was named after the street of the persons house htey use to meet in the basement of to discuss the start of the business and launch. 

Having a bigger studioe will allow them to rent to bigger production who come ot MA to film, this will be additoinal income and also a way to start to build relationships, so they can get some sub contractor work form the bigger studios as well. 

Another area of focus is to work with companies who win big government grants, they dont want to go after the grants themselve but target partnerships with companies who win the grants in a sub contractor type relationship.

They did hire somebody to management their books with in the last year, so they said the financials have been a lot better. However, one goal would be to get more project based accouting to get the details on each project.  The projects and clients are very project specific which can limit recurring business.

She used to work in Digital Advertising (which I'm learning is a big market for us in Sponsorships, Marketing, Advertising space) Vegas but her firm's biggest client was Google who didn't renew her contract so she got laid off.  She's from New Jersey originally I think but think she comes from a military family.  Nice person, a bit oblivious and 'tells it how it is' which I respect.  

She just started at JSX (the Semi Private airline I took one time) as a flight attendant so this might be a plug for Semi Private flights.  She just got done with training so maybe a longer term play but they fly out of Vegas so could be useful. 

She also has a Schedule C (Shade and something?) where she organizes groups on trips all across the world.  She was telling me about it one time and it seems different.  Basically her company gets people to join a pool of like 10-20 people.  The company will then book the flights, hotels, etc. and get preferred rates because of it? Seems like she organizes dinners & activities too.  For me, if I'm going on vacation I want to do my own thing but guess it might be fun to be part of a group as well.  She says she usually gets the travel for free because of that so basically gets free vacations for organizing / supervising.  Kind of makes it not a vacation though.. 

Either way, she says she hasn't really made any money off the business and she had multiple people tell her that since she didn't make any money than she doesn't have to file taxes.

"Feb 15, 2025",Prospect/Client,No,,,,,,,,,,No Work Item Needed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Caught up with Dave regarding his Financial Advisor referral (Amir).  He wanted to give me a heads up that the client that he is going to refer us to who is a very high net worth individual.  Amir is a CFP & Enrolled Agent so he does all the financial & tax planning/prep.  His client is looking for a bookkeeper.  Dave said to be mindful of staying in our lane which we are well versed in with our FA clients.  

He said the client is currently paying $90,000 per year in bookkeeping fees.  Dave says he has a business but believes that most of his income is driven from a large real estate portfolio.  Not sure if that means it's bookkeeping for a bunch of rental properties but this will be a decent amount of work either way.  Think we should start ramping up P24 quickly and consider bringing Matty home.  

Also said Amir will probably ask for a Rev Share of the Bookkeeping fees which I'm very okay with.  Dave said it'll be good to have agreements ready so I'll do some ALFRED work prior to the meeting.  

Also caught up with Dave about Motta and the successes we've had over the past year.  Dave got really excited about that and immediately got in touch with one of his business partners with the idea of buying CPA practices with retiring owners then absorbing their portfolios via ALFRED.  We've explored this avenue in the past but decided on the organic growth route. Plus we weren't at the point of acquiring firms yet but think we're pretty close.  

He talked to his Business Partner (Dan I think?) and Dan said ""Fuck that"" because he heard that BDO (Top 10 CPA firm in the country) just sent 7,000 letters to their clients saying they are cutting that service line and they need to find new CPAs.  Dave says him and Dan have equity in a company called Domain Money that brokers deals there a firm will ""Sell"" Domain a book of business and Domain will create financial plans for financial planners or take the clients completely from the financial planners.  Domain will then pay the financial planner a % of revenue for that set of clients.  Dave is thinking a similar structure here where we'd take the 7k clients from BDO and pay BDO a percentage of the client fees.  He threw out 25% but he wasn't sure what it would look like. 

Dave's initial interest was sparked by the idea of converting Tax clients to Financial Planning clients.  He estimates we have about ~$100m worth of AUM with our tax clients just waiting there for us.  Where Dave wants to plug in would be to help teach us how to convert our tax clients to financial planning clients.  He said his fee for that can be anywhere from Pro Bono, Fee based, Rev Share, or Equity (just on the MWM side not the Motta side).  All interesting avenues but Dave is ELITE from a distribution/network standpoint so I'm open to the conversation.  

He says he'll work the back channels for after tax season and that it's critical that we lock our process down to be able to absorb 7k clients.  I'm not sure what client mix looks like but if they are getting tax performed by BDO than they are probably some whales in there.  

He also says that his mom is working her last tax season and will be retiring from her tax/bookkeeping shop in MA so that she can move down to St. Pete's with Dave.  Dave says he's expecting his first child in September so it'll be good to get her closer.  He says she'd be open to working for Motta part time as well.  Because of this, he says he doesn't need us to do his taxes for 2024 but definitely in 2025.  I don't think we would have charged him anyways so less work for us but exciting opportunities!",https://app2.karbonhq.com/4mTyp9lLRWTC#/work/2tzzryyV5MMf,,,,,

Clinton has a Funding brokerage shop where he helps companies get funding either from banks or from private financing.  He says he closed $680m in loans or some ridiculous number and funded 5 companies this week.  Business is growing a lot and he seems like he's going to get into the Hedge Fund / VC space soon enough.  

From a tax standpoint he said he used to have an accountant and his taxes weren't that difficult but he's since been divorced and started a business.  He said he did his own taxes as a business owner with other ventures going on all in TurboTax.  He has a $42k bill from the IRS for 2023 and he said it's been hanging over his head and he wants to be done with it.  He says his new wife gave him shit for it because she wanted him to be debt free before they got married.  His business partners are also giving him shit for it because he helps get companies financing but he's in debt himself.  He says he put aside a majority of his commission on deals aside so that he can level set on taxes and just get everything fixed and paid off.  He's pretty confident he didn't do his 2023 taxes correctly and was very open about how it's a shit show.  He wants us to help with the abatement (IRS Support / Consulting) which he estimates would shave off like $11k and also an amendment.  He also wants 2024 tax prep done but 2024 will be less noise.  Only consideration is that he took all his income as a distribution and not a salary which he knows probably is going to hurt.  

Talked through the pricing cause he said ""Give me a price and I won't hold you to it"" and I said to get everything cleaned up for 2023 and re-filed than probably around $1,000 - $1,500.  I said once 2023 is done that our tax prep is min $450 but 2024 will be vanilla so we'd be do it for around $250 - $300 for just the 1040 portion.  I said we'd be able to help as much as we can from a pricing standpoint but he said he wants to support business owners and he gets it.  

Despite this, seems like he's still building the company through our conversations about entrepreneurship.  He also said he's already recommended us to a few different companies and also that he knows a few CPAs in his network and he doesn't give them any of his financial information so seems like he'll be a good partner overall so I'll take care of him.",https://app2.karbonhq.com/4mTyp9lLRWTC#/work/v5T3SpqQ77L,,,,,

Think she'll be a good client and she was super appreciative for the conversation.  It was on Zoom phone and I'm not sure how to access those recordings or summaries but I called from the Main Line.  

Camille is an attorney who used to be a Legal Researcher & Writer for a judge but she basically would sit in a quiet room writing 1 document for weeks and she hated it.  She's a defense attorney now and she's really enjoying it.  Seems like she's on a commission structure because she said her income is continuing to go up.  She was big on seeing if they should MFJ or MFS because she has student loan interest and other potential credits that she'd probably qualify for ordinarily but when they factor in her husband than it doesn't work.  Her big consideration is her student loans because it is income based, I believe.  Most likely MFS for that alone but we'll see.  

Her husband drove for Lyft last year and think had another W2 job (in HVAC I think?) but now he's a W2 bartender and think she said he made like $100k from that so there income is around the same this year.  

Talked through our fees a bit and she had already asked about what we charge hourly and if there was a fee for the consult.  I told her that it's already considered into our fee so that we don't have to invoice clients for 15 minute phone calls.  She found this refreshing as she lives in a ""Big firm billable hours"" culture now.

I think I commented on the Proposal to go $250 but think there will be some noise and she seemed to resonate with our value/fee structure so I think we get this return at $350.  

I'll send thank you's and tax doc requests but she also says she's weird and saves everything so think she'll turn around docs relatively quickly.  Also says she handles most of the finances so she'll run point but it also wouldn't hurt to get his contact info for our client database purposes.",https://app2.karbonhq.com/4mTyp9lLRWTC#/work/3jf45GQhdq7y/tasks,,,,,

Lonsdale is a friend of Brian O's, he is currently in real estate, as a 1099 realtor working for  big new developments to get the houses and units sold as they are being built. Londsdale is not sure when he last filed taxes, he think he needs to file taxes for 3yrs, wants to get up to speed and stay on top of things moving forward. Talked about making sure QBO is set up properly and getting him going on estimated payments if he decides to stick with real estate space but step one is filing taxes. 

He used QBO off and on for tracking his Realtor business but he will need to go back through to make sure he has all his expenses. He said the last 3yrs he made around 30k, 80k and 50k most recently in 2024. Went over Home Office and Mileage deductions. 

Also, has owned vending machines for the last 2-3yrs. Currently has 1 vending machine, said he uses a software cantalpoupe to track the income and he would be able to send us a report. It is located in a friends business, where he doesnt charge them rent, so the only expenses are the snacks and processing fees for card transactions. 

Currently renting in MA so make sure we take rental deduction. 

Potentially has paid student loan interest but not much, siad he stop paying the student loans and has deferred them all

They are both Self Employed.  Matt is an Insurance Adjuster and Becca is a Realtor.  We talked through business owner deductions and they said a list of potential deductions would be helpful. 

Matt had an IRS bill which he will be done paying off in March and Becca has a tax bill that she's making payments on in 2023.  Matt says he made estimated payments this year and I said we'd review Becca's 2023 return in case there was anything that the previous CPA missed.  

They also asked about who should claim their two children and the mortgage interest.  They purchased their home and actually bought points (i.e. pre paying interest) which is also deductible.  I said we'd see where they would have the most tax savings (i.e. if Matt or Becca should claim the children/interest).  The Mortgage is under Matt and his parents Co-Signed so that he could get the loan but they aren't on the deed.  Becca is on the deed and I think you can still split up the Mortgage interest but let's do some research on that.  

They said they are still working on getting their tax docs (W2, deductions, etc.) so we booked a follow up meeting for Tuesday 3/18/2025. They just wanted to get on our radar before it gets too crazy.  

They also said their parents had an accountant of over 20 years who passed away last year so he said they wanted to make that introduction soon.  They are retired so should be an easy return.

We had briefed gave the students the CL and briefed CL on the class.  

We had access to this QuickBooks Online account so we reviewed what we saw as a class before the meeting and talked through our questions with Alvis while on the call.  Also gave Alvis an idea of what we are looking to do (see slides from the 2.10 accounting clinic) with some education on QuickBooks and how we're looking to organize the data.  

Alvis was super open and appreciative. Even shared that all of this is new to him as well so he's learning just as much as the students are.  He also gave the students some insight & perspective about how to be a good accounting consultant.  He talked about his previous experience with CPAs and how transactional the relationship is with no guidance or education on how to get better.  

From a tactical standpoint, we still need to:

(1) Integrate their sales platform (Shopify) with QBO.  Mark & I had tried to do this with Alvis on Friday but they were having trouble with Shopify.  

(2) Their QBO is linked to their business bank account but the information only has 2025 data.  We need to request that Alvis pull the transactional detail from the bank website (in excel or QBO upload form).

Troy's a friend of mine from Las Vegas and started talking to us last April because his family needs to do more tax planning.  

Troy used to work at Charles Schwab and has his Series 6, 7, 65, and 63.  He doesn't work in the Wealth Management space anymore but he does do day trading (mostly options trading) with his father and also works some part time jobs at True Food Kitchen in Summerlin as well as Target Deliveries.  He says the day trading made about $65k last year (under his father's name as it's his father's money) and says that he's built a pretty good portfolio that makes money when the market is up and down.  At Charles Schwab, his job was to build portfolios so he's allegedly good at that.  

His father worked at Raytheon as an engineer for a long time and retired from the company a few years back.  They have been paying him a large pension which totaled around $5-7 million which is mostly in retirement accounts but a portion of it in a brokerage account.  I believe this is the last year of the pension payout (Troy said it was over a 5 year period) but his dad also has another job working remote for a smaller engineering company based out of California.  He makes about $230k a year doing that and Troy isn't sure how much longer he's gonna work.  Parents are old school Asian parents who just work until they die.  

Troy hinted at wanting to work at Motta but I told him our Wealth Management practice doesn't have the AUM that requires us to hire someone strictly managing portfolios.  As a client, I think there's opportunity to win the family's business and although Troy is a LOMAR right now, he says him and his sister will be inheriting the assets (estimated around $10m) of family money which he plans on using to trade in the market in the future.  

I'll send out quotes, thank you emails etc.  He also provided his W2 and 1099 for True Food Kitchen/Target and I updated the Karbon Contact will all the info I know.",https://app2.karbonhq.com/4mTyp9lLRWTC#/work/4lvlcSctlJkT,,,,,

She's in Business/Corporate Law and he's a lawyer working in Government Contracts.  They both work in DC and just bought a house between DC and Baltimore.  

He has a tax lady right now but he was looking for a new one because him and his wife are now just starting to make some money and looking to invest (real estate, brokerage account, etc.) which she said was too hard and too much work.  Textbook prepper.  

He's originally from Canada and about to get an inheritance from his grandfather in Canada.  He is also part owner of a rental property up there.

We went though the requests live and he provided PY tax returns, W2, and 1099s.  Also provided a P&L from his bookkeepers with Northwestern Mutual.   He says he logged into his QBO and there were bank accounts that don't exist anymore and missing info (For example, he says rent on his P&L was only $X dollars a month but he knows that it was supposed to be more than that because he had an office for his staff as well).  I think we can populate his schedule C via the P&L we have as a starting point and he said he was going to clean up his QBO a bit before providing us with Accountant Access.  Also talked through expenses such as vehicle & travel that is probably incomplete from his P&L as well.  I sent him all the requests so he can start working through that.  Ideally we'd get his QBO access and map it in but realistically I think it'd be too much to clean up his books then map so probably gonna be manual for 2024. I sent him a proposal for tax prep as well but think this one is ready for input. 

From a partnership standpoint, talked through the different relationships we have with FAs and he was leaning towards a Ross model where he is white labeling our services on his team.  The main reason being that he has a friend/client (who started a medical devices company) who has a group of 10-15 doctors who are looking for a financial planner.  I think it's for a Surgeon group / company and they are looking for a provider for all of their medical professionals.  He said an important part for them is a Financial Planner, a Mal Practice Attorney, and a CPA that is familiar with Surgeons who are business owners.  He said he's talking to them over the next couple of days but he said he's 100% in on partnering with us and white labeling the Motta services.

Students did great! 

She talked through her different revenue streams, major partners/contracts, and a lot of discussion around processes such as sourcing, pricing, etc.  

From an Accounting Clinic standpoint, seems like Tracy is still 'wearing all the hats' from a sourcing, selling, treasury, etc. so she has a rough idea (she says highly educated guess) of the numbers and finances in her brain but it's not documented or built out in a structure/process so it's not scalable.  

She also went through a series of products and opportunities but she wasn't sure from a numbers standpoint which products make money and which do not.  She definitely knows the ones that don't make money and the ones that do but again, educated guesses (more on that in a second).  She says she has a bookkeeper but from what I gather, she knows the pulse of the company from a financial health standpoint but doesn't have the exact data (i.e. numbers) to provide specific details.  She does say that every year her and her bookkeeper talk about doing a massive clean up project on her books to really set it up but they always punt to the following year.  Think SEED is a good opportunity for that, we have an army of well trained accounting students to help with that! 

(Picking up from earlier) Talked to Chaim on the side about Bifurcating her business between Non Profit and For Profit.  This would be a similar set up to OpenAi with a hybrid type model.  Maybe the legal or other clinics can look into this but I think this would allow her opportunities from a grants perspective while also being funded by the For Profit side.  Think it might also help from a marketing / branding standpoint.  Think this creates a win-win so that she can do what she's passionate about (feeding kids healthy food which I can't say enough about how important that is. Fun fact, Japan hires a full time nutritionist at all of their schools) that won't make a profit but also grow the For Profit side to fund those initiatives.  

That's a whole project that we can talk through but from an accounting standpoint, I think the first step is to get access to her books in order access her data.  She has 17 different products currently and they don't seem organized so that's step 1.  I know the A-Team is shaking the cage to sink their teeth into their books so as soon as we can get access (and the paperwork), we can get started! 

I'll discuss the SOW with the Accounting team (Jessy/Amiyah) as a homework assignment but great meeting overall and very well run by the students!

Basically I had an intro call with him, then met with him again when he was in Vegas for the Rodeo, then gathered his preliminary tax documents, then drafted the return to show him the tax savings opportunities for the strategies / planning we talked through.  

He was super appreciative and found the conversation super insightful.  He said this was what he was missing from his old CPA.  He always just submitted documents but the old CPAs never gave any insight or education on what other deductions he can take.  He's starting to get a better understanding of that.  

He's going to go and gather all the expenses for his Rental Properties (Montana / Colorado) as well as the Barn he built on his property which he's never taken credit for on his tax return.  He got a couple IRS letters for balances due in 2022 and also still owes like $6k in federal taxes from 2023.  It's cause he wasn't taking all the real estate deductions he can.  He'll want to go back and amend those taxes too.  

I created the Client Financials for Witt and also drafted one of those Tax Advisor plans.  Mostly because he was a referral from Harrison and because he's a good ""Printer / Ink"" candidate.

So that we're doing the math at home, he started as a Indy with a Schedule E and now it can turn into 2 additional returns, 3 LLCs.

She is under LOI (""Letter of Intent"") to sell her medical transportation business which was valued around $3.6 million but she's getting offers in the low $4's for it.  She is hesitant because she didn't feel like she had a plan and that the broker was a little pushy.  

He has a bookkeeper and CPA but she says they are more preppers than advisors. I talked about our experience with TLL and real estate properties and the tax benefits related to that.

The founder is an ex VC/PE graduate of Bowdoin and Chris, along with a group of Bowdoin alum are looking to pool their money together and invest in this start up. 

I don't know exactly what they do but they essentially have an 18-24 month exit strategy so textbook ""Start up, cash out, bro down"".  What makes me skeptical is that she said she tried to get investors at a $750k minimum, then dropped it to $500k, and now allowing any level of investment.  

A piece of the business is essentially a lie detector test which they might spin off and sell to police departments and shit. 

For us, it'll be a MMLLC or Partnership formation for 6-7 members who are ultimately going to use this legal entity to invest in the start up.  I don't know what the name of the target company is nor do I know who is in the NewCo LLC (we're forming it so not sure what they are ultimately going to call it).  

He asked what it would cost and told him the bulk of the expenses will be with the operating agreement as there are a group of investors and think the agreement would be relatively complex but maybe I'm wrong.  I told him for us, it'd probably be around $5k - $8k and total start up costs are going to be around $8k - $15k ish maybe.  He was okay with that. 

I think we had some sort of Questionnaire to the information we need to form the LLC but I communicated to him what are the key details we'd need in order to form the entity. 

For the entity itself, looking to: 

1. Debrief with Caroline to see what she's seen from a legal entity standpoint for companies like these.  I would imagine she's come across this as her former clients probably ultimately breaks down into SCorps & Partnerships at the base level. 

2. If Mark can talk to our lawyer friends (once we figure out what state we're forming this in) and start to get pricing for the Operating Agreement for this type of entity.  

From a pricing standpoint, I think we had $2,500 for a MMLLC formation or something like that but think it'll take us a little more time due to the speed & complexity of the project.  I'm thinking closer to $5k but maybe we show ~$5k and discount down to like $4,500 or somewhere in that ballpark.

They are 2 Co-Founders (Manny & Alvis) and in their first year they did super well and made $760k.  Then they purchased a bunch of inventory and demand didn't keep up so they overextended with NewERA so had to dig themselves out of a $200k hole in 2024.  I think he said they ended at $183k or so.  He says they've got their stuff squared away and he expects them to have a big year in 2025.  He says Jaylen has been awesome and he said he'd even do a few collaborations with their store to help.  He said we'll be invited

What they don't have squared away is their accounting.  The founders haven't taken a salary and they do not have payroll set up... they'll definitely need that.  He says they use Shopify as their POS and Quickbooks Online.  He says they have it all linked up and it syncs pretty well but I'm guessing this one is an absolute mess so there will be plenty for the students to work on for this one.  

I gave him the layout of how the firm works and the importance of his involvement over the next couple of months to help us the information we need to get their books squared away.  He was super receptive to that and said he'll be available whenever we need. Or Manny, who he'll introduce us to. 

I'll send a follow up email and start getting access to all of his systems so that we're queued up to have the team start working on it.  We could potentially get a meeting for 1/27 (next class) if we've had a chance to do a proper discovery process and brief for the students.

Referral from Harrison who had nothing but great things to say about us.  Hannah has known HH since grad school and he has been her financial planner since that point.  

Savannah's dad is a financial planner so I think he uses him but she said she ""knows enough to be dangerous"" from a tax knowledge standpoint.  

Talked through our process and they said their current accountants don't really do much for them from a deductions standpoint and they haven't taken any simple deductions such as home office and what not because the CPA said the standard deduction would be more.  I don't know how they came to this conclusion without even kicking the tires but seems like a easy close.  They also said they keep getting IRS letters for small administrative mistakes so I think the quality is poor as well.  

They wanted to turn around the quote as quickly as possible as their current CPA is sending them an invoice for their 2024 taxes.  I told them I'd bundle their business returns with their individual returns so we can be more flexible with pricing.  Also said they'd get the 15% partner discount via our relationship with Harrison.  

They wanted payroll services as well and use Gusto.

It's actually a pretty easy one (I thought he said her husband was going to need a FS compilation but just a simple confirmation). 

These will be easy so I comp'd it because (1) Our current relationship with 3PM is a bit hectic this week so getting back some Goodwill and (2) Realtors {especially the 3PM ones} are phenomenal referral sources.  

She also said she just switched CPAs again but they didn't want to do the letter.  I told her most tax people are tax preppers and she really resonated with that.  She's also a branch manager for 3PM so talked to her briefly about working with her on that front.  She seemed excited about it.  

Long story short, I think she'll be a great referral partner and we'll be working with her a lot through 3PM so think this is a good step towards starting that relationship. 

Plus they're both loaded so they probably are selling homes to HIMAR people who probably need tax services.

They've gone through a bunch of accountants who were all old white men and did everything in a very old school manner.  They are just looking for someone with a more modern approach and more strategy vs just a prepper. 

Amira is self employed with an 1120s and a SMLLC.  D-Ro has a W2 and also has a DJ Sole Prop on the side.  Side note, I thought he was DJ'ing (which he also does) but the business is essentially finding DJ's for events.  

David has a financial advisor and Amira says he has some brokerage accounts, CDs etc. which should be pretty straightforward.  Amira's dad does all her retirement stuff.  Another side note, Amira said her dad immigrated from Egypt with $300 and started as a Janitor at some grocery store and now runs all the stores in Oakland.  He retired at like 42 and now is basically a day trader so he manages her retirement accounts. 

Amira also has a bookkeeper for her businesses and she does the bookkeeping for D-Ro's business.  She's basically his business manager as he's not exactly a numbers/finance guy and she knows an impressive amount regarding finances, accounting, and taxes.  Seems like she grew up with that stuff through her dad but from what I gather just from speaking with her, she's a smart cookie and knows more than the average person as it relates to tax rules.  She says her accountant says the same thing.  

Already sent the Thank You email and Proposal for Amira. Also asked her for the QBO access for her businesses and asked her if she'd like us to have her run point for both their tax returns or if I should reach out to D-Ro as well.

I send them the financials and said we'd be able to get them draft 1065s / K1s once those questions are answered.  In the meantime, I think Andrew can start to map the accounts and don't think there is any PY info but if there was activity, we would have done it this year. 


Also don't think they ever paid for the LLC formation (mostly cause it's not 100% done yet and we failed to get the document notarized AGAIN.. It was my fault the first time and Chris' fault this time) but they said they wanted to pay the proposal so that they can get everything squared away for the project.  

Brian - I think there was a quote / proposal from hubspot for them that we moved over to Ignition which probably expired.  Just copy that exact proposal (and make sure we have a Bookkeeping one for them) and send it over.  They are a Partnership technically so I think we have to ""Add Signer"" and add Rickey to the proposal as well.

He's going to send over his compensation statement over but I think he said the amount of Carry they gave him as of 1/1/2024 was worth $20k and he wasn't sure what the amounts are going forward.  From what I've seen, if it's $20k in Year 1, it'll probably be worth like.. $200k + in less than 10 years.  

He's young, not married, and earned a very high income so I told him that it's good that he's killing it from a life standpoint but not so much from a Tax standpoint because the IRS puts those types of people in the highest tax bracket.

To do is to send out the proposal and returning client document requests which is basically just 2 W2s.

He's retired at this point and also recovering from lung cancer which he had a couple of surgeries for during 2024.  

Eric's currently drawing from his retirement accounts as Wendi (Dre's mom) is a house wife thus it's their only source of income.  He had an accountant who retired and he was passed off to someone else at the firm who they've worked with for the past couple of years.  He says the old CPA basically does the bare minimum for them and thinks it's because they are too small for them now.  I hate hearing that stuff and feel like we hear it all the time. 

I don't think he's working with an Advisor so might be a Wealth Management (more Wealth preservation) type of client and the Jacobson's have had me over for a bunch of holidays and treat me like family so looking to make sure they are taken care of.  

He's also thinking of selling their home in LA (Brian O and I looked it up and the house is paid off and probably worth ~$5m).  He's thinking of relocating to Las Vegas as the cost of living in LA is not great for retired folks.  If he does sell, guessing that'll be part of the Financial Planning / AUM conversation as well.   

From a fees perspective, he insisted on paying as he said ""This is business"" but they are a pretty simple Indy client so I'll work with Brian O from a fees perspective on this one.",CA_JACOBSON_ERIC_5480,,,,,

He's a referral from Stu Galvis (who I've never even spoken to but he's referred us multiple leads already). 

Jared said he's currently working with a bigger firm (not sure which one) but he's got a lot of spice to his return and seems like the people there are either not interested in his complex Indy return or they are not familiar with all the crazy shit he's doing.  He has 4 rental properties (5 doors so think one of them is a multi family) and also does a lot of trading with Crypto, securities, etc.  {Side note, he said 2 of the rental properties are in LLCs and the other 2 aren't ""out of pure laziness"" so might be advisory opportunities down the road although he seems like a bright dude so might do that himself.}

He also said he wanted to start an SDIRA to get a golden visa in Portugal.  I'm not exactly sure what that means but I'm sure ALFRED will be able to give us a good idea of it.  Long story short, he's a high net worth individual who has his hands in a lot of different things.  He asked about fees so I told him I'd send him our fee schedules for 2024 but he'd AT LEAST be a 1040c with 2 Schedule E's and at least 1 Schedule D.  I told him we'd send discovery docs before we can finalize pricing but told him it depends on the complexity of the client.  

He has a ""wife"" named Hilary who's studying for her CFP.  They aren't legally married as they've both had 2 divorces and don't see the value in getting married but said it was because he didn't see any tax benefits to it because they're both high net worth individuals and said he thinks there's more flexibility with contribution limits for retirement accounts and such.  I don't know if that's true or not so said if they both do their taxes with us (they don't co-mingle finances at all it seems like and she has a different CPA) than we could do the return as them being individuals and MFJ to do the math to see if it would be advantageous from a tax perspective.

She currently works in Marketing for Universal Studios and she's a bartender for supplemental income while she is putting in the ground work for acting career.   

She's currently taking acting classes, workshops, etc. and also is writing a short film.  She has spent a bunch of time on her film career and not taking credit for it.  Her and a group of actors put together a Short Film (""Laughing to Death"") which was a bigger project for her.  

All of this is because she's owed money every year because of her bartending gig (W2 job I think) but she's not taking credit for her 3rd job as an actress where she easily cracks the 500 active participation rules.  Thinking if she takes credit for all the money she's spent for her acting career, that should hopefully offset most of her W2 jobs.

He's currently using Seamus O'Brien's (another WMHS 2008 graduate) recommended accountant who is a tax prepper who is Seamus' girlfriend's friend or something.  The guy is your typical Tax Prepper.  He's already all in on working with us. 

Matt has a W2 job as a Fire Fighter for Woburn but also started a ""Natural Insect Spraying"" business or whatever called Ticked Off LLC.  It's a SMLLC he started it 3 years ago and it's been growing every year.  He also purchased a house with his girlfriend in north Woburn in July of 2024.  

He uses Jobr for his Client Scheduling platform and QuickBooks Online but he said the systems aren't synced up properly so he literally keeps all his receipts and punches them into QBO.  He says even then he's not sure he's putting them in the right categories and it takes him a ton of time.  

He'll be a 1040c from a Tax Prep standpoint as Ticked Off is a SMLLC.  I'll send discovery requests out as well as QBO access to get initial docs.  He'll most likely need Bookkeeping Onboarding and Quarterly Bookkeeping services probably.

Endorsement was so good he basically said, ""Yeah I'm in"" after hello. 

Tyler is a super bright dude, he opened Kraken BJJ about 5 years ago as a Schedule C and will be going SCorp in 2024.  He actually was on his QBO while we were on the phone and got access to his QuickBooks during the intro call.  Super productive.  

He needs help with Taxes for this year.  He has taken quarterly draws but also has a W2 Salary / Bonus.  Think he said he's paid himself like $65k in W2 and the business is at like $70k profit.  Income will probably be around $150k for him all in.  

Kraken also is expanding (with a franchise model) and a friend of his just opened up a franchise in Kansas City.  He says he gets 5% top line which is about $500 right now but expects that to go up.  Also said he's looking to get to about 5 franchisees over the next few years but wants to do it right.  

Tyler is also in the process of purchasing an investment property in Michigan.  It was their family house that's on 4 acres of land that's been in their family for over a century.  He purchased it for $140k (appraised value) and looking to put that into an LLC.

I changed up the quote that B made to exclude Bookkeeping as I thought he'd want to get the LLC established first but he seems like he wants to do the Bookkeeping before he forms the real LLC.  Think his side hustle is under the company's umbrella right now so the LLC isn't critical and they have their own accounting system but he doesn't like it so he wants to have them set it up and open a QBO with us than just transfer the data instead of setting it up from scratch.  

He said he wanted to do taxes for sure and wanted to see what bookkeeping would cost.  He was looking for a package like the Entrepreneur Essentials (I'll tag the Client Resource (CR) to this debrief for Brian).  

Let's revise the proposal into 2 proposals.  

(1) Tax Preparation: Individual (1040c), Onboarding (Bookkeeping), and QUARTERLY bookkeeping review (think we have it at $150 a quarter).  

The strategy is to reduce Tax Prep fees if they sign on as Bookkeeping because it'll get us the onboarding fee and the recurring revenue.  We don't give a fuck about Tax Prep fees and if we can give up tax prep fees in Year 1 for recurring accounting fees than we still win.  So give a small discount (if you want, B) but if anything, give the discount on taxes and email the proposal to the client explaining that Tax Prep fees go down if you are an accounting client of ours because we already have all their information. 

(2) Proposal for Entity formation (SMLLC) but set it for January / February of 2025 and give it a longer expiration period.  We know he's going to do it eventually so just want to get it in the pipeline to track.  

I'd also put the same Entity formation (SMLLC) as an OPTIONAL service to the first proposal and make it cheaper if he does it all at once.  Meaning, if he bundles the Advisory services with the Taxes/Bookkeeping than the entity formation is cheaper than if he waits and does the LLC formation separately.  

See link to the proposal below.  Brian, feel free to make those changes and blast it out.  One thing to be mindful of is that there were a bunch of duplicate services (think some were the Ignition default ones) so make sure we're using the services that are linked to a QuickBooks Account (i.e. Tax Prep goes to Tax Prep) and that the service descriptions are robust.  You can tell the ones I tuned up because I also added specific service terms for each service while I'm cleaning them up.

He asked about standard deduction vs itemized, said taxes are not bad where he is at, i mentioned Mortgage interest as a big one where client get bumped into itemized but with him only owning the house for a couple of months most likely be standard for 2024 and we can look at it for 2025.

(2) Andrew to get caught up on this client and also take an FGA at creating a Bi-Weekly payroll processing work item.  I'm pretty sure it's on auto but think there should be a recurring work item to track it.

Mark to take the lead on this one for the WM prospect.

(2) SMLLC for the wife's Yoda business. She had one awhile back but stopped and then they started another in 2024 but did nothing with it but looking to do more in 2025.
(3) MMLLC for a rental property that they are 50/50 owners on.
(4) MMLLC for their market research firm because a friend of theirs hired them for a project so they formed the LLC for that project and looking to do more in 2025.  

He has QBO for his music business but unsure if he has it for anything else.  I think they could benefit from even the QB ledger for his other businesses just from a tracking standpoint.  It'd be pretty light onboarding I'd imagine and think P24 could do it easily.  He'll need tax services for all of his businesses as well.

Witt is a power line worker who has a remote job right now but used to have to be on the road which was tough from a family perspective.  He's from Montana but met his wife in Denver when he was in town for work and now they live in the Southwestern part of Colorado in the desert.  They've got two sons (7 & 2) and both the husband and wife are W2 workers.  Seems like a very blue collar family. 

His father in law is a contractor who built their home and they have also added a ""Caretaker unit"" which they rent out and a barn on their lake that their neighbors rent to store their boats.  He also has his house he bought a long time ago in Montana that started with an informal rental but he just kept renting.  

His frustration is that his current accountant sends him a binder of his tax return every year after he spends about 3 hours gathering all of his expenses into one of his CPAs templates and then he drops it off with her secretary for $1,600 per year.  Seems high for a 1040 Schedule E but not sure what that lady is doing.  I asked him how helpful that binder was and he said ""not really"" then said he can't even talk to her for more than 10 minutes and she invoices him for it.  He basically said he's paying her for data input and even the intro call has been more valuable than his 5 year relationship with his current CPA.  

He also said he eventually wants to put all of his investment properties (Barn, Caretaker Unit, Rental Property) in LLCs so talked that through with him and went way over his head.  

There's about a 100% chance he becomes a client so I'll send him the full tax intake.  He was very well organized and had all his numbers in a notebook.  He also said he wants to be proactive during the year so if it's easier for us for him to just send us documents when he gets them, he just wants things to be as proactive and efficient as possible.

She explained the process for how they earn money and some of their more complicated payments such as their lease, how they earn money and how that comes in, and expenses / headcount / growth plans to get an idea for what they have on the horizon. 

Couple thoughts for me: 

(1) I think this job can be P24'd as of now, books are in decent shape and I think we can start layering them in from a categorization standpoint.  

(2) We will start to buildout the monthly reports (i.e. reorganize the chart of accounts and add reports to the Management Reports to send on a monthly basis).  I think we add the Monthly Balance Sheet & P&L as a stock report for our clients and think we add it to this one.  We asked her to start to look at it to start to group / reorder accounts to really start to build it out.  

(3) Depending on the growth that Ariel noted, might make sense for her to go to ADP as she's currently on QB Payroll which isn't great.  

..sidenote from an FP&A standpoint, they get $180 private pay and around $130 from Health Insurance. She also is starting to go group sessions which will be $210 per session.)

(4) Make sure we get the lease docs and loan documents.  Might take an FGA as far as building out those reports for this client but TBD on that.  

(5) Do a quick review of her books and potential review their tax return to see if there are any areas of potential savings (LLC vs SCorp was what she asked about).",https://app2.karbonhq.com/4mTyp9lLRWTC#/work/2zH6PtCbnyg4,,,,,

Ron's a retired disabled military man who was a professor and also worked for the military (or military contracts) in ""Cyber Penetration"" from how he described it, his job was to train the military on how to hack into systems.  He could legitimately (and probably is watching) hack into our system right now.  

Ron left the corporate life and joined the entrepreneur life like ourselves.  He says he's emptied his savings and started 4 businesses (which I added via his LinkedIn and created contacts for in Karbon).  The businesses are US Computer Support (trains people how to hack into stuff I think?), SomeOfTheBestDeals (selling business where he has contracts with eBay, Alibaba, etc.), and Chit Chat (a social media website that has all the capabilities of Facebook, Twitter, and Tiktok.).  He also said he invents Ai apps and said he was thinking about inventing an Accounting Ai App but didn't have the expertise (I brought up a collab).  

He says Harrison is the advisor on all of his businesses and that he doesn't have any money right now but has contracts signed that start in January.  The problem is that he needs to get set up on a Salary this year.  I talked through pricing for Payroll and said it would be $500 for basic set up via Gusto and $99 per month for payroll & compliance.  He said he wanted to pay himself out of two of the businesses so I said the set up fees would be the same but the monthly would only be $150.  He said he didn't have any money and he has all of the employment ID items set up so he can do a lot of the the work on his side.  

He also says a lot of his large contracts are with Microsoft, US Military, etc. and they require his financials as part of the contract diligence.  He said his books and records are an absolute horror show right now.  He also asked about selling his businesses so I talked him through BizEquity and our capabilities there.  He says he knows Intuit as well (another point for asking him to help us with ALFRED).  

He's a very straight to the point man so would fall under the ""Jordan Rules"" category but he said he trusts Harrison and if Harrison is recommending us than he trusts us too.  At the end of the call he was thrilled and excited to get started. 

I'll take the Payroll Set Up but want to also start on the tax return piece of it.  This has extension written all over it but think if we can get him up on Payroll, it will be a good win to earn his trust.  He says he has all the information handy so think it'll be a good exercise for me to go through it with him and see what he knows.

I also brought up bookkeeping with him but Jared was planning a departure from NWM due to the high compliance and lack of flexibility to work with CPAs like us.

She still hasn't filed 2023 taxes and said she's trying to get us over her info.  Let's hope she follows through this time.  She asked to amend after the audit is complete as well.  

I went and cleaned up all the Karbon contacts, Quickbooks, and Work items.  Also sent the instructions for her to sync her bank account with QuickBooks and also sent a request via ADP.   She said ""they"" set it up and she doesn't know the log in.  Not sure if ""They"" is ADP or someone at Giang Enterprises.  She said she had someone semi managing it but she's going to take over the reins.   

TBD on Taxes and Accounting Onboarding but on the Payroll Side.  We'll see what the lift is for the Payroll Clean Up but we'll have to get it cleaned up for the audit so they'll all be under the same project.  For the Worker's Comp audit, also researched pricing and said it's between $500 - $1,500 depending on industry.  I think our prices for Worker's Comp audits should be hourly or Fixed Fee for $1,500.  For this one, I think we list at $1,500 on the quote and discount down to $1,000 due to the bundling with the Payroll Onboarding and Payroll Services.

Her husband is ex-arena football quarterback, Sean Brackett, who is a teacher at Waltham High School and also the head football coach.  He also is looking to start a virtual coaching class so she said it's a good time to find an accountant.  He makes about $85k in wages.  

They also have a rental property (condo) and they are looking to purchase another property soon.  She's also 9 months pregnant and due with their first kid (daughter) in 2 weeks.  Lots going on. 

She said she cashed in about ~$85k in RSUs in 2024 and she gets a new tranche of RSUs every year so she wants to make sure she's doing it intelligently because she did not do that in 2024.  She cashed out tranches that had some ST and LT cap gains considerations and based on their income, their might be some AMT in there.  

She cashed them out related to diversifying from her financial planning with Tish but there's a lot of tax implications here so think this will be a good opportunity for us.  Also another Pro Athlete in the portfolio technically.

This will be his first year doing everything so it's all new to him and I think he's a bit green on the business, accounting, and tax side of the house.  He said all the bookkeeping is done on a spreadsheet because it's so minimal.  I doubt the last part a lot and think it's going to be shit show. 

He didn't take the intake form but said he would, the contact information as far as email address was made up so I can start the debrief form while I was on the call.

He just sold his house 2 weeks ago and has about $100k net from it.  He said he sold it at a loss which got a bit awkward but think it was driven by the divorce.  Either way, he was the ""I have a bunch of money and I don't know what to do with it"". Talked through high level planning mechanics such as diversification but said Mark was our guy for that although I dabbed in a past life.  It turns out, Sean used to be an advisor as well with MassMutual.  He said he's currently not working with an Advisor and loves working with us so wants to keep it all in house.  He also said he has a Solo 401k that he opened himself and wanted to bring that over as well.  I said we're most likely going to contribute to that from a tax savings perspective anyways so we can do all of this at once.  After we get a plan together and know what he's going to have as far as assets, we'll finalize the trust.  

Do we think this is an Italian Job? We can do it from an RIA standpoint as we're registered in Nevada but not sure about life insurance.  I think a Whole Life policy would make sense for him.  Especially if he's self employed.  

He also said he got a couple IRS notices saying that he was going to get about $8k back (great job us, if I remember, we were a bit more conservative so this generally makes sense).  He said he sent the letter to Sweeney and was wondering how long it was going to take to get the money.  In my opinion, I think he'd me more than happy to just pay us the $8k for the financial plan along with all his accounting, payroll, and taxes for 2025.. idno, we'll see.  

Action items: 

1. DLe to send an email introducing Sean & Mark. 
2. Sweeney to research the tax letter to ensure it's just the IRS taking a long time to pay people
3. Mark to compile a list of documents we need for financial planning.  ChatGPT'd a common request list, see below.  
4. Mark to schedule time with Sean to roll his old Solo401k over.  I think we'll contribute to it for his tax stuff and he said he always has trouble contributing for it.  
5. Mark to open a Brokerage account for Sean so we can at least put his money in a money market fund for now.  He has it in a savings account and he didn't like that it's depreciating. 
6. Mark to look into insurance options for Nevada.  I know Landon Mance is a planner here but not sure if Hunter or Gaye would be licensed in Nevada. We can also get licensed ourselves but not sure the lift on that.  If it's easy enough, WL policy commissions are niceeeeee",https://app2.karbonhq.com/#/work/HNh7kP3lPh6,,,,,

He also gave us an email intro which I will pin to the work item.  I also added both Adrienne & Michael and their respective businesses into Karbon.  A bit of googling but not the necessary contact info (I think).   

Michael says they'll need the CPA verification and/or P&L in February for a Construction Loan (this is very similar to the Sally Wu client so let's not fuck this up) for around ~$4 million with a property value over $10 million or something.  It might have been a $2 million with $4 value but I heard all of those numbers so not sure.  Either way 7 figure loan.  This won't be till February but wanted us to get queued up early. 

I'm not sure if they are together or just biz partners but Michael said they were both business owners.  

Adrienne has a Realty Shop and also used to be a professional athlete (runner) in Amsterdam and now some hot shot realtor.  She has a pretty decent size team of Realtors so could be a good lead referral stream.  

Michael is a Partner at LMB Partners. LMB is ""Law Meets Business"" and the firm specializes in transactions.  I briefly read he did some sort of $10.5 million dollar Cannabis transaction.  Probably too big for us but who knows, we seem to start to be dabbling into the M&A space.  

I sent out the email for the Intake form so we'll see what comes back but think the idea is to get their taxes (and may do their taxes?) but start to get the process together for the CPA verification.  We'll probably definitely need bank statements for her but not sure what we'd need for Michael.  I think it might be a Letter for her and P&L for Michael.

It was with Brian / Ann at their home that they use as an office as well.  

I think we did a terrible job on this client since bringing them on so wanted to see how their experience has been and what areas we can help.  

Matty has never sent them financials for their books.  I sent them their QB Management Report and Gilgun was super confused on all of that.  We talked through the P&L and started to talk through how we are doing to do a full COA Scrub (AG is working on this currently) then we can change account names, mappings, rules, etc.).  Once we get the data cleaned up, we can start to develop analyses and actually provide financials that make sense.  

For example, right now he's pricing jobs based on a 12% estimated overhead.  Not sure if that's correct.  

Brian also talked about tracking Projects in QBO.  He's currently just doing it on paper right now and not really tracking.  We can start to implement this in QBO I think. I asked him to scan/send all those bids and quotes so that we can start tracking.  We'll need to do data clean up before we can fully implement.  

He talked about how they are taking less work but around the same Revenue / Profits.  He says it's been frustrating to stay around the $1 - $1.5 top line mark and not grow.  

We talked through some business strategy because (1) he says he pays significantly higher than the competition (2) They are spending tons of unnecessary costs such as

(a) His Foremen (project managers) are not doing a great job and just not great from a leadership or management standpoint.  Brian says it's creating a toxic environment and costing the company dollars.  For example, he says one of his guys leads jobs but hasn't got his license in 7 years so that limits his abilities and makes jobs more inefficient.  

(b) Equipment Rentals because guys break tools all the time and they need to rent additional to get it done. 

(c) Lost tools.  He said they had 11 ladders at the beginning of the year and now they have 5.  No one knows where they are. 

Along with these costs, Brian is spending most of his time leading projects and not leading the company.  He says he's okay with paying his guys the highest compared to market but would like the quality if that's the case.  He says he's going to do some restructuring.  

I suggested an incentive program for Foreman.  Right now their bonuses are arbitrary cause Brian's a nice guy but I told him if their bonuses was based on Project performance (efficiency, injuries, tools, etc.) that it would give them a reason to care about those things because right now there are no tools to keep them accountable.  He loved that idea.  He has 3 Foreman and 1 of whom the company thinks is a ""Kiss ass"" because he cleans the tools after he's done and makes sure job sites are tight.  I said if you pay him the biggest bonus, others will see that's how they make more money and think it would be helpful to save on all these lost money.  

We talked about some other business strategies such as buying a dump truck for around $40-$50k and I said that was a no brainer as they are spending ~$2 - $5k a week on dumpsters.  He got an auto loan with Capital One so he's gonna pull trig on that in 2024.  

He also uses a large portion of his home for Adze including (1) Parking Trucks & Large Equipment (2) Using his separated barn as storage for tools, equipment, etc.  and also going to convert that into the Adze HQ.  (3) Large offices for Brian / Ann.  (4) He also hosts company functions at his house.  

I told him that he can either write those off or he can rent his personal home to the business as well.  He was very excited about that idea. 

Action Items on our end are: 

(1) Clean up COA - Andrew
(2) Add vendors to transactions - P24
(3) Schedule regular monthly meetings with Adze - Dat

Great guy, just checking in and making sure he's doing things the right way. Guy is more organized than 95% of our client.

Still working a 9-5, doing some bartending, then also this LLC side work.

He's sort of shifted from low level electrical work to overall handyman work, wants to make sure he's compliant with how his LLC is structured. I think he'll be fine.

Has an excel sheet with expenses for LLC (materials, fuel, food receipts, vehicle repairs/maintenance, miles) basically everything you can think of.

Has a business checking account & credit card, doesn't mix any personal with business, vice versa.

Only thing that's changed from last year is transactions through the business, but thinks with all the repairs to his work vehicle he'll be close to making no money, but still squirreled away from money in case he owes taxes (smart).

Actions Items:

-Wants a good list of items to track for write offs (home office) uses garage, yard for storage, basically anything he didn't think of, industry specific or not.

Mark - potential financial advising client for sure.  He's very interested in investing and making some coin in that area

He has investments kind of all over but questions include:

-Investments to make off 401k, HSA, if they should pull ETFs and invest differently
-About $100k in home equity, what can he do
-How to raise credit

Wants to check in once more before tax season, maybe talk to Mark about Financial Planning, but not much to do now. I'll be in touch with him sometime in December and pop off a tax quote then.",https://app2.karbonhq.com/4mTyp9lLRWTC#/work/2lDlSBlbnZZD,,,,,

She has a bookkeeper right now who I think is virtual and in the Philippines or something but she says she's happy with him. The rest of her experiences with accountants has been terrible.  

Her first accountant did her taxes wrong by taking her top line revenue number as net income.. yikes.  Then she went to an accountant who is a super nice guy but fucked up her quarterly taxes twice so she said she didn't trust his work but wanted to continue working with him because he's a nice guy but wanted to bring in a tax strategist for oversight.  He got offended by that and left so she worked with this CPA lady who said she'd take care of everything and was 'good' but literally can't get a hold of her.  She is the type of person who wants to get everything done on time and she's very diligent about providing things in a timely manner so it's frustrating because she had all her stuff done on time but the CPA didn't file her taxes until 9/15 (ext deadline) when she had her shit over to her in time for 4/15.  

She's an SCorp already and talked her through salary considerations but when I said she was doing all the right things and paying herself a salary she hesitated as if what I just explained to her isn't what she is doing.  She also said she hired a W2 employee but doesn't think the withholding taxes are set up correctly and she's currently putting some money in a savings account because she doesn't think enough taxes are being withheld.  

She said she wants us to help with payroll from  a clean up and oversight perspective (basically onboarding and payroll client) with quarterly tax estimates.  She wants her biz and individual return too which I said was $1200 (I should know the new prices by now) and also said she wants to do Tax & Financial Planning but I said let's see what we're working with first so that we can build a more intelligent plan after she gets cleaned up.  She was very receptive to that.  

From a quote and pricing perspective let's do Complimentary review / assessment, SCorp/Indy return for stated prices, payroll onboarding / clean up for $799 (confirm this after we get access to gusto), Payroll & Compliance for $99 monthly.

First item to take care of is creating an LLC for this Turo business he's been dabbling in. Wants to register the business in Wyoming for tax purposes (will need registered agent services, Dat also pitched the idea to form in Nevada for similar tax advantages). He doesn't want to have to deal with the day to day transactions so let's also include in the quote bookkeeping onboarding & monthly bookkeeping. We should have a better idea of that lift after discovery docs but he did say he was tracking as much as he thought he should on a google doc (stupidly optimistic it isn't complete ass).

He also mentioned wanting to get into the vending machine game in the near future so if we handle this first LLC creation, bookkeeping, and his taxes well then I could see another Biggie Smalls package in the very near future.

He kind of gave me Ben White vibes so we'll need to keep an eye out for a million questions and may need to hop into a consulting retainer if it gets out of hand.

Action Items:
Dat - Send a follow up email and begin the discovery doc requests to see what we're dealing with

Nick - take a quick peek at the google docs and see what kind of shit show we're potentially dealing with, then circle up with me on bookkeeping onboarding pricing

On his side, the market is down so he'll end up around $170 income this year from his W2 job.  

Walked him through Elmira and the Notary of that OA but I told him we've gotten started on the Elmira QBO account already so just need him to sync up the account.  I'll send that request.  

Also he said the rental property he's been renovating is now being rented and he has it as Subsidized housing.  He said the two bottom bedrooms didn't have something so the Section 8 people gave him a rate at a $200 loss for the year but he's going to put those in and they should be good in the long term.  

I asked him to gather all of those documents and that he should keep it all in a separate bank account and that we could manage all of that for him.  I'll create a request list for this year but he said it's probably going to be easier to open a new personal account and use his bank account as biz because the Section 8 people have that bank account for payments and stuff so might be a nightmare to change.

Derek is getting the $1.2m pay out this year as he is an owner of CEI Constructors (Civil Engineering Co in CO) which was sold.  I believe there was a buy out because they informed me that he will be getting a payout for the next few years (until around 2028). Not for $1.2m but will be significant and all W2. 

I talked to the RE Pro benefits as they make too much money to go towards retirement to offset the W2 income.  

Went through Cost Seg / Solar and other considerations around being a RE Pro.  Seemed to resonate.  Jenna seemed like she wanted to aggressively lean into the RE Pro and purchase another property in 2024 to reduce the tax liability.  They might purchase a couple more as this income will remain high for a few years. 

I talked them to solar too but their investment property is a townhome so the HOA owns the roof.  They asked if they did Solar on their primary if they would get the same benefits but told them they'd get all the same tax credits but not the accelerated depreciation which is generally the big advantage.  Derek did say maybe not for their primary but it will be a tool in their tool chest for future properties. 

I also talked through financial planning and they didn't seem to have an advisor.  Could be a good planning and AUM opportunity.

From a pricing standpoint, I presented the rough fee schedule and disclosed that this is baseline and that pricing would be based on what path they take. I told them that there was a 20% discount if they go with the Tax Plan and the discount would be applied to all the items within the plan.  

Action items are for me to check in over the next couple of days and see if they want to move forward.  Seems like they do and think there will be A LOT of project expansion.  

If she is leaning into the RE professional career, there is going to be some ADVS, BKPG, and tons of Tax planning so this could be a big one.

He just purchased a home in NC and was thinking of selling his home in AZ.  He purchased it for around ~$300 and has $280 left on his mortgage.  He currently has it listed for $410 and has been in the AZ home for 3 years.  He already purchased his new home so want to confirm he'd still qualify for 1031 exchange. 

He actually was talking about potentially keeping the property (Harrison mentioned this and suggested it) because he was going to sell and put the money in the market.  He knows the NC home isn't a forever home so the plan is to stay in NC for 2-3 years and then go from there.  I talked about rental properties and the real estate market in general including the HELOC.  Seems like he was now considering keeping the home.  

He said he is going to NC for the Marines but also might have to get Medically discharged which means he'd be retired.  He's not sure of that yet but either way, he'd stay in NC for the 1031 aspect.

We are here to empower and influence these filmmakers to open up their own production companies. The more more successful black owned production companies there are here in Boston, the less excuse the big marketing agencies will have of not being able to find minorities in the film industry in Boston; an excuse unfortunately heard way too often.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,S-Corporation Income Tax Return (1120S) - $1125,,,,,,,,,,,,,SEED,100,MA_SEED_BOSTON

Our mission is to provide affordable studios, performance spaces, and educational resources to artists, creators, and organizers, with a focus on supporting the BIPOC and arts-driven communities.

Having grown up in one of such communities and seen my dad leverage his artistic expression to grow a successful business, I learned firsthand about entrepreneurship through art.

Yet majority of them have to work multiple jobs to earn a sustainable living.

So we walked her through the differences and emphasized the importance of LLC for liability portection and than we could analyze S-corp designation for her once she was an LLC sounds like she is on the cusp right now but if her business grows a little more would be a good fit for her.  Most of her revenue comes through a contract she has with the state of maine. Her income is consistent an nice fit for Scorp as well as making quarterly tax payments which she asked about.

We have a Zoom recording and Meeting summary as well so that will be attached.  

Turns out, her Solo 401k is with Invesco, not with Harrison.  He only handles her Northwestern Mutual Signature Portfolio Premium Brokerage account (which he informed me was around $400k).  I also texted her afterwards because that isn't efficient.  Generally you are charged less fees if you have a higher balance at one place.  Especially with the Sig P at Northwestern, I used to work with clients in that space so did a bunch of work with that team and also went to a handful of their trainings.  Pretty good product and service is really good.  If she moved her retirement, she'd already be over the Sig P threshold (which I think can vary but my office had a $250k minimum for that or something).  

We also talked about retirement strategies for Tecia and Raquel basically said she's mentioned it but Tecia hates talking about anything finance related.  I feel that on the tax side as well.  Pretty sure Hunter is in charge of that one.  I think Harrison said Tecia has a Whole Life (perm) Insurance policy and that Alayah as a WL Policy as well.  

Talked through the DAF, savings plan for Alayah, and retirement stuff with Raquel as well.  Talked through the mechanics of it all to ensure we're aligned with Hunter's side of the house.  He agreed with it all.  

One thing that he thinks will be key is the DAF.  He said she expressed that she wanted to open up her own gym and how that could be a Non-Profit that is funded by the DAF.  Once it's registered as a 501(c)3 the DAF can grant that NPO this cash.  It's actually brilliant.  Tax savings now to fund a post-retirement venture. Harrison was impressed.  I sent him the Motta 1-Pager on that as well.  

Action items on our side is to do a Tax Plan (Dat) and to open her payroll accounts (I think Gusto will do.. and also Mark get those started with Sweeney/Sophia on support).  

After Raquel left Harrison also talked about his practice and how that he's a field director, the CFO of his region likes to do a YE P&L review with the field directors.  He knows his books are behind but they sent him a 10 minute QBO training video to prep him for this.  I think he's really trying to nail this so want to get this books caught up as quick as possible.  I think I'm gonna meet with him again because his platform MUST interface with QBO if they are sending him trainings about it.  I want to personally take care of this one (with the help of P24 which I'll get them started on).  He said he synced his bank account so we should be ready to Rock.  Ganesh, use the P&Ls provided by his previous accountant as a reference point as we're building the chart of accounts and categorizing transactions.  He's a financial advisor.  He collects money from selling life insurance, managing investments, and a % of revenue for his office as he's the head of his satellite office.  

He also talked about a potential client.  The wife is the superintendent of some school system and the husband also does some W2 type job.  She earns a pension but he says that how the compensation system works, they start paying the first year of the pension the last year of the employee's working year.. so they get double compensation that year.  They also don't have a lot of tax deferred assets and their income is too high to do anything now.  Harrison said to max out their other retirement plans through work but that won't make much of a dent.  He asked about real estate investment strategies so I briefly talked about the RE professional criteria.  They said they wanted to do a ST rental... in Mexico.  He said he suggested the same thing  but didn't know the tax side of it so wanted to loop us in.  Tax lead as well.  Nick to research this side of the house.  Brian O asked about Cost Seg which I suggested along with Solar and he seemed receptive to it.  

Also talked to Harrison about the instant chemistry as we went into a Collab client meeting and really worked well with each other.  I think he sees the value of having a CPA in his holster.  Especially if it helps him bring over more AUM with the Solo 401k.  He said Raquel is one of his more important clients and that he trusts us a lot.  I think we've successfully executed on his first referral and the partnership is growing in a very positive direction.",https://app2.karbonhq.com/4mTyp9lLRWTC#/work/2JD7Xw94bYRw,,,,,

Met with Connor at 3PM for a weekly meeting to help them improve their processes without anyone's knowledge and not getting paid for it. 

Connor is basically manually calculating commissions and branch P&Ls instead of using their commission system to do it. I think Matt was trying to build a journal entry to help band aid this but think they need an infrastructure overhaul. We talked about needing to revamp their infrastructure when they grew big enough. 

Mitch also wants to implement an Employee Stock Option Purchase Plan (ESOP) so let's do some research on that from and potentially loop in a Specialist for this. 

Audit Readiness Debrief

I have asked Matt/Paul to assess the lift from getting from Cash to Accrual and haven't seen anything on that front. We need to get started on this (maybe AB)? So please find time this week to talk about it. 

Business Valuation

I took the FGA with the old system for Biz Val and I think someone took an FGA with BizEquity on this. I think next steps are for quote and then see what they want to do with it or how much they would like us to help. I think this was more or less for them to gauge how much they can sell 3PM for and I don't think they're doing that anymore because the company isn't worth enough. 

 Action Items

Paul - When is the next monthly meeting? Please make sure Mattys meetings are deleted and we have the monthly meeting on our bookkeeping template with what deliverables we need for each meeting. 

Brian O & Sweeney - Level set on scope / billing for this client. Check what they signed quotes for. I'm planning to bundle all of the above as in level setting on their contract. If you guys want to draft up a quote for this convo, that would be ideal. All the projects are based on consulting hours estimates so work with the teams on that front. 

Dat - look through the docs for infrastructure revamp. Send the biz val. And email Mitch about level setting on the contract. Him and DJ are out here the first week of November so I can talk to them about it then if not earlier

Met with Raquel as her taxes are late to get some last details for 2023 but also talked about all the other projects we have going on including planning for 2024.  I’ll provide those updates in the 2023 work item directly and update notes in that work item but this debrief is going to hit a bunch of different things.  
1.	Taxes (2023) – Got final numbers so those will be submitted today
2.	Taxes (2024) – Income: Tecia made about $240k and Raquel made ~$900k top line from a purse standpoint.  They both also have some small endorsement & sponsorship deals (Raquel said Venom pays her $25k).  Raquel also said she got PPV points for the last fight which is based on PPV buys so she’ll get that payment within 120 days of the fight after numbers are settled.  She said she expects that to be around $1.2m and some more over the next year if there are additional PPV buys.  All in income is probably around $2.5 million.  There’s a lot of room for financial / tax planning.  Harrison is her FA so unfortunately no AUM on this one.
3.	Dan Johnson LLC – We went through the Agreement and she gave me all the numbers from her initial contributions so I’ll finalize those.  She also said this one will be a flip and the house is currently listed for sale and she will probably get a ~$100k cap gains on that project.  
4.	Lincoln – She’s dumped a bunch of money into this but it’s a 4 unit and they’ve renovated the property.  She said they have renters ready so as soon as they are done, it’ll see income.  They are also getting HELOC on the property to repay her initial investment.  She also said she wants Bookkeeping on Lincoln but wants to talk to her partners first. 
5.	New Property – She is closing on a Cabin on 11/4 which she plans on using as a ST rental. She’ll need an LLC on that.  
6.	Team Rocky – She wants full Bookkeeping & Payroll including set up.  Payroll will be monthly and she won’t need reporting or anything.
7.	Team Tiny – Same with Team Rocky. 
Dat to Finalize the LLCs and get a video Notarization on the books.  I’ll also finalize the 2023 returns today and start/distribute work items for the rest of the work projects.

He doesn't actually do anything but finds the service providers (lawyers, CPAs, etc.) in order to get the acquisitions done. Pretty cool job actually and could be a good channel for us for project based consulting work. 

So there's a Parent Company (who I believe is under PCAOB standards) is looking to acquire an E-Commerce business called Wookoo.  Lily sent me the pitch deck so I'll include that along with their website and all that jazz.  

Lily said the last auditor was a 1 person shop who was able to do the audit in 3 days including helping them write the financial statements (which I don't think is technically allowed for independence issues) but seems like a smaller company.  $7 million top line and I don't think they have much of a balance sheet.. Nick would know better than I. 

Lily will introduce us via email but they were shooting for Mid November to get this done.  She wasn't sure if it was a Audit or Review and also if it was PCAOB or AICPA.  That significantly changes the scope so I said I'd at least talk to them about it.  

We'd have to register in Texas (they're in Dallas) in order to do this but if it's an AICPA audit it'd be easy and if it's an AICPA review it's even easier.  I did some research on Texas requirements for firms to perform audits and it's basic shit.

Jenna is a homemaker in Colorado who also had a short term rental (Property #1) which has been in an LLC since 2019 and in the market for another rental property (Potentially Property #2) which is why they are working with Mitch.  They are currently looking and put an offer in on a home but it didn't work out.  Jenna isn't optimistic that they'll find what they are looking for is as the inventory in their area is very low.   

She also has another LLC (started in 2022 she thinks) for property management which hasn't done a ton with from a sales standpoint but has been working on really creating a ST Rental conglomerate.  

I talked through the RE Professional criteria and she definitely qualifies as she has no other income and spends much more than 14 hours a week (750 a year) between the ST rental bookings, property management, and currently working on renovating the ST rental since September.  

They are currently squatting at the house right now and she said the whole ""I'm not sure if you'd like me to change that answer for tax purposes"" but she said they had to renovate and figure they'd use the livable space while they renovate and look for another house.  She projects that renovations will be done next June but also said that could all change if they purchase another property as that would require a lot of capital.   

She has a small 1 person tax shop working on the property management LLC and her husband's company handles their individual taxes.  

Her husband has a W2 job at a place where he also earns a K1.  I'm not sure what he does but she said the company is being sold in the middle of December and he's going to get a massive payout from it.  The tax firm is a larger regional firm called Wiffy or something? She didn't seem satisfied with them or didn't trust them because she asked if we could review her previous returns to see IF it's advisable to amend.  She just thinks that the accountants would look out for the businesses / OG owners' best interest vs the lower level shareholders so think she just wants us to take a look to see if everything looks logical.

She essentially wanted to talk to an accountant with the big K1 distribution coming in and their current home buying process, she just wants to make sure someone is doing the math and guiding them to make sure they are (1) Planning for the big pay out (2) When that pay out happens, would it be advisable to purchase another home to save on taxes.  

She said the business is going away and said they could go with the same firm but she's currently looking elsewhere.  She basically said that if we look at her returns and have a good plan for saving on taxes in 2024 than she'd just move everything over to us.  

I originally had this as a Dwyer job but it's looking kind of more on the Sweeney/Nick train.  Maybe Dwyer on support. 

She asked about fees (saying she understand it depends) so I gave her a high level walk through of pricing with BASELINE tax pricing and told her amendments are hourly as the scope can vary.  She seems super smart and gets it.  Seemed like she left the conversation satisfied. 

Next steps are is that she's going to take the intake form (we don't have her email currently) then I'll send her our materials on RE Professionals, fee schedule, and the document request list. 

We aren't at quote stage yet but I'd say it looks like 1040c with 2 LLCs and also said we'd review the documents and see if an amendment makes sense complimentary (which I think is part of our process anyways).  I can't tell if this would be considered tax planning (i.e. planning for 2024 pay out and advising on if it makes sense to buy another investment property) but open to thoughts from the team from a pricing standpoint.",https://app2.karbonhq.com/4mTyp9lLRWTC#/work/33nNzpdR2Scz/tasks,,,,,

She said after our last discussion, she was finally able to look at the client resources we sent over and she's been worried about starting her business (cleaning mostly) and having something happen if one of her 1099's fuck something up at the house.  She says she works a lot with Realtors and helping with cleanings for staged homes so if the cleaners break anything there.. she thinks it could be bad.  Her biggest concerns were legal protection and business insurance.  

First, she wants to put her rental property into an LLC.  This was with her brother so it'll be a Partnership LLC (Basically the same thing as Elmira). I told her the filing and stuff is easy but the big thing would be the Partnership agreement but it's technically not 'mandatory'.  I said up to her since it's family but she really wanted to establish a structure which I said was smart.  Partnership formation + Partnership agreement here.  I think we use the one we used for Raquel for her MMLLC for her rental property as a basis.  

For her cleaning business, it will be an entity formation for that in Colorado as a SMLLC with an operating agreement with that one.  I also talked to her about the Entrepreneur Essentials package which she LOVED.  So LLC Creation + EE package. 

Action items are for Sweeney to draw up the quotes on these for the itemized pricing for all of those individual items listed. Include the state filing fees for both states and stuff like that too.  

I'm going to use this client as an opportunity to create a EE type package but for Real Estate clients / Rental Properties.  This will be for the class of clients we have that keep buying properties (Martin, Raquel, etc.) so think it'll be good to have a product/package in this space.  Super easy lift and easy P24 job.  

Action item for me is to send her background instructions for operating agreements (same shit I templated for Raquel) as well as the EE package.  

Also is that LLC Creation questionnaire still out there? I think we can deploy that here and build it into the template as well (if not already which it probably is).",https://app2.karbonhq.com/4mTyp9lLRWTC#/work/xRYhZ9Ln13P,,,,,

I'm not sure if she was just saying this for lower fees but remember her saying she hears Chris on the phone while he's talking shop and how great Motta is to work with and how they are the backbone to all his plans. 

Thalia has a rental property in CT (she's in CO but originally from CT.. she moved to CO specifically for Chris) that I think she 'technically' owns with her brother.  I feel as though she deals with a lot of it.  The rental property was a Schedule C or E for her last year and I remember we did an amendment for it as well because she had did the driveway over.

We first talked through Motta and moving over to to ADP on our side.  Pretty straight foward. 

Talked through TLL and some of the features and items that they would need for their operation.  

He said it'd be around $325 per pay period for TLL and ~$160 per month for us but obviously that goes away once we hit 3 clients.  He also said he could give us 50% off or something for months 4 through 6.  

It was good to get a walkthrough of the software (which is basically the same as all the other ones) and resources (which I think is the difference maker).  To understand the features and how it could be a solution for our clients.   I assumed that it would be better but would come at a higher cost as they are built for larger companies.  

Ryan actually told me that he probably opens 9-10 single owner SCorps a week for small businesses who are SCorp so they have to have a salary on the books.  I asked him about pricing and he said for that situation with payroll run monthly, it would be around $100 per month including all the resources.  I said that's double what Gusto charges but you get a lot more so it makes sense.  He said he will never lose a client for pricing so it seems like he'd be able to be pretty flexible.  Seems like he's just trying to get more businesses onto the platform and not just the larger clients.  I was under the assumption that it was just too large of a software but he said that he'll always be able to find a price to work for these businesses.   He also says he'll actually drive to the business and train them on the software or help them get the State ID numbers if they need it.  He's the small business guy so he hinted that ADP considers this an ""emerging markets"" of sorts so they are just looking to get businesses on their system and hope they grow and will upgrade later on.  

He talked about Rev Share and how they are having a promotion right now that he will send us more details tomorrow or end of the week at the latest.  Same as Gusto but they are giving pretty large bonuses for new firms from a Rev Share standpoint.  He said if we get X clients, we can get a $5k bonus or something.  

As a firm, I think we'll still use Gusto but this guy seems like the service would be great and if he's going to work with us on pricing, I think ADP should be our default payroll referral partner. 

From a client standpoint, he said he'll send quotes for Motta and TLL by tomorrow as well.  I said while he's at it, send quotes for Team Rocky and Team Tiny cause I think they will be ADP people.",https://app2.karbonhq.com/4mTyp9lLRWTC#/work/2x2NWrxPlsHd,,,,,
"Oct 7, 2024",Prospect/Client,No,,,,,,,,,,No Work Item Needed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Had a 15 minute intro call with Jason Salit who is the current outsourced CFO for Hancock Processing.  Looking at his LinkedIn, he was a former E&Y guy but learned that he mostly worked in Banking and was also in the mortgage industry.  I remember Tyler telling us that him and two other guys (another mortgage guy and an accountant guy) started a company before Hancock and sold that before he started Hancock.  Then he wanted to sell Hancock and when we asked what he would do next, he'd just start another company with those other guys.  Doesn't make a ton of sense to me but learning that the Real Estate industry is filled with used car salesmen who are into the ""Pump and Dump"" method of entrepreneurship.  

I think Jason was the accountant guy that Tyler was referencing.  The good news is that the guy seems very competent.  The bad news is that he seems like he wants to keep everything in house.  I asked for access to his QB and he was hesitant and made it clear to not change anything in the system.  I said we mostly only need it to sync up with our Tax & Biz Valuation Software.  He then said he isn't sure if the Tax Mappings are correct and I told him we'll take a look and would just suggest mappings if anything.  He then said he'd give us User Access not Accountant access so that we couldn't change anything but then gave us accountant access because he wanted to save the User slot for other people.  I thought User Access would have more access than Accountant but either way.  

He was definitely stern and came off like a dick but I think he's just skeptical of some of the professionals out there and didn't want someone like David Winter fucking around with their books.  I don't necessarily blame him.  I will say if we had Tyler's full trust, Jason wouldn't have pushed back as hard. Part of me thinks that after we talked through some of the tax questions he had, he figured I was qualified.  Not sure but either way, I think Motta is in the ""Vendor / Service Provider"" bucket and not the ""Partner"" bucket.  

From a business valuation perspective, I think we sync up the books and run it through the Biz Valuation tool.  We technically haven't ""Sold"" the report to him yet so maybe there are marketing materials we can send him about that.  We also need to figure out how much we're going to charge for just the report and how much we would charge in order to help them with projections and assumptions.  Me thinks this guy will just want the report so I think at a minimum, we'd have to send some sort of proposal and/or sample of a report and see if he wants to purchase it from us for $X dollars.  We'd still need to send a request list of assumptions for them to answer even if they just want the report (Growth rates, Officer Comp, etc.) so think this will be an FGA client for that.  I would have rathered a client that we had a closer relationship with but this isn't terrible. Sweeney, Nick, and Mark on support for this one.  I'll also be involved.  Action item is to review the QB once we get access to it then sync it up to Biz Equity.  Then get some sample deliverable, Proposal, and Request List for the info we need.  

We'll use this work item to build out the steps and save it as a Karbon work template after.  Nick to run point on this.

From a Tax standpoint, I think he was also hesitant because of some of the poop going on in 2024.  I said getting access to the books to see if there's anything we should do before YE. 
 He asked about SCorp election and said they were gonna do it 1/1 because they thought it was too late.  When I told him it wasn't, he also said the company also had a Loan to Tyler during 2024 which is another reason why Jason was hesitant on moving to SCorp.  The loan is paid off and the method that Jason used to pay off the loan was basically if the HP made a profit of $100 that month, Jason would make a Journal Entry (JE) to reduce the loan by $100 to pay it down.  Essentially instead of paying out the profit then Tyler paying back the company, he just did it via JE.  I'm sure the correct accountant way would be to do all the steps but I think as long as your documentation is there, this is the more efficient step. He said he wasn't sure how this practice would impact the SCorp filing as he was more concerned about it from a compliance standpoint but I told him that there would be basis implications either way so we'll do the math on that.  

Jason is aware that SCorp is the more advantageous route and would save them a zillion dollars on SE tax but he's concerned from a compliance standpoint which is why he wanted to just take the hit then start fresh 1/1/2025.  Although I think that's something we can look into (maybe BB?) but I don't really think this dude understands legal entities in general.  On to the next issue I'm seeing when figuring out if they should do SMLLC or SCorp is that Tyler is paying himself a salary.  

From what I believe, it's still a SMLLC as of now but Tyler is getting paid a $5k per week salary.  I asked if they are withholding both ER/EE taxes and he was dismissive and said that they are withholding all the regular payroll taxes. I don't think he was understanding that the owner of an SMLLC can't pay himself a salary.  I did some research to confirm that this is not allowed but I don't think a majority of people understand this. Shows that even if you're a talented bookkeeper that you're ass in taxes and legal entity shit.   

Action items here are: 

(1) TAX: Do the math to see how much additional he's going to have to pay in SE tax if he keeps it as an SMLLC cause that number could impact how much risk they are willing to take on a compliance standpoint.

(2) TAX: Look into or ask BB about the Loan and Loan Repayment to see if that will be risky from an SCorp compliance standpoint.  Avoid BB if we can figure it out on our own. 

(3) TAX: We're gonna have to do this anyways but do the basis calculations based on salary, loan repayment, etc. because Jason admitted he didn't know that world but that would be a big factor in their practices going forward. 

(4) ADVS: Accept access to their QBO 

(5) TAX: Review their accounting including the tax mappings

(6) ADVS: Sync their QBO with Biz Equity. Maybe we just send Jason the link to fill out the info? I think we'd get the report either way.  

(7) ADVS: Find some sample deliverables or marketing materials for Biz Valuation. We technically haven't closed this one so want to make sure they sign a quote before we provide anything formal. 

(8) ADVS: Come up with pricing for Biz Val for just the report and if they want us to consult on the assumptions & forecasts.  Also there's a menu of types of reports we can provide so pricing for all of that on an itemized level.  I think there's some research to be done on that market is for each individual report to see if it makes sense or just 1 report always.  

(9) MKT: Create a client resource as a PSA to tell people the implications if you're a SMLLC and pay yourself a salary.  I'll drop the research I did below and also comment on the debrief note.  


SMLLC: Owner Salary Rules and Implications

Question (Compliance): Can the owner of a single member LLC pay themselves a salary without considering the salary a distribution?

Answer (Compliance): No, the owner of a single-member LLC (SMLLC) cannot pay themselves a salary as they would an employee, and that payment is not considered a salary in the traditional sense for tax purposes. 

For federal tax purposes, a single-member LLC is treated as a **disregarded entity**. This means the IRS views the LLC and its owner as the same entity. The income generated by the business flows directly to the owner, and it's reported on the owner's personal tax return (Form 1040, Schedule C).

Here’s why it’s different from a salary:
1. **No W-2 for the owner**: In a sole proprietorship or SMLLC (taxed as a disregarded entity), the owner is not an employee and thus cannot issue themselves a W-2 form. Any money the owner takes from the business is simply a distribution of profits, not a salary.
  
2. **Self-employment tax**: The net income of the LLC, after deducting business expenses, is subject to **self-employment tax** (Social Security and Medicare) rather than payroll taxes like employee wages.

3. **No withholding**: Since the owner’s payments aren’t classified as wages, there’s no withholding of federal income tax, Social Security, or Medicare taxes directly from the payments. The owner must make **estimated tax payments** to cover their tax liability.

The only way for an LLC owner to pay themselves a true salary, complete with withholding and payroll taxes, is by electing to have the LLC taxed as an **S corporation** or **C corporation** (via filing IRS Form 2553 for S-corp or Form 8832 for C-corp). If the LLC elects to be taxed as an S-corp, the owner can pay themselves a “reasonable salary,” with proper payroll tax treatment.

So, in short:
- **No salary**: Payments to the owner are treated as distributions and not as wages/salary.
- **Taxes**: The owner reports the LLC’s profits on their personal tax return and pays self-employment taxes.

Question (Implications): 

What are the implications if the owner is receiving a salary and only withholding the employee payroll taxes? 

Answer (Implications): 

If the owner of a single-member LLC (SMLLC) is paying themselves a **salary** and only withholding employee payroll taxes (Social Security and Medicare), while not properly treating the payments or withholding the employer’s share of taxes, several potential tax and legal issues arise. Here’s a breakdown of the implications:

### 1. **Improper Classification of Payments**
   Since a single-member LLC is considered a **disregarded entity** for tax purposes (unless an S-Corp or C-Corp election is made), the IRS doesn’t allow the owner to pay themselves a salary or wages. If the owner is treating distributions as a salary:
   - **Mistaken Tax Treatment**: The IRS could consider those salary payments as misclassified distributions. This can lead to the IRS **disregarding the payroll altogether** and treating all income as pass-through income on the owner’s personal tax return, subject to self-employment tax.

### 2. **Self-Employment Taxes vs. Payroll Taxes**
   - As a single-member LLC owner, the entire business income (minus expenses) is subject to **self-employment tax**, which consists of both the **employee** and **employer** portions of Social Security and Medicare taxes (totaling 15.3%).
   - By only withholding the **employee portion** (7.65%), the owner is underpaying taxes because they aren’t accounting for the **employer portion** (the other 7.65%) of Social Security and Medicare taxes.
   
   - **Tax Consequences**: This underpayment can result in:
     - **Underpayment penalties** for the employer portion of taxes.
     - Interest on unpaid taxes.
     - Potential scrutiny from the IRS if they notice that the proper amounts of payroll taxes aren’t being reported.

### 3. **IRS Penalties and Fines**
   The IRS takes payroll tax compliance seriously. If the owner is only withholding the employee portion of payroll taxes and failing to remit the employer portion, the business may face:
   - **Penalties for underpaying employment taxes**. This can range from **2% to 15%** of the unpaid taxes, depending on how late the payment is.
   - **Failure to file employment tax returns (Forms 941, 940, etc.)**: If proper employment tax forms aren’t filed, the business could incur additional penalties.
   - **Trust Fund Recovery Penalty**: If the withheld employee taxes (e.g., Social Security, Medicare) aren’t properly remitted to the IRS, the owner could be personally liable for a penalty of **100% of the unpaid tax**. This is known as the **Trust Fund Recovery Penalty** and can be assessed against individuals responsible for the unpaid tax, including business owners.

### 4. **S-Corp Election**: The Right Way to Pay Yourself a Salary
   The owner may have misunderstood the rules about how to take a salary from their business. If they want to pay themselves a salary:
   - The **SMLLC must elect S-Corporation status** (using IRS Form 2553). Once that election is in place, the owner can pay themselves a reasonable salary, and both the employee and employer portions of payroll taxes must be withheld and paid to the IRS.
   - **Employer responsibilities**: As an S-Corp, the LLC would be responsible for:
     - Withholding both the **employee portion** (7.65%) and paying the **employer portion** (7.65%) of payroll taxes.
     - Filing quarterly payroll tax returns (Form 941).
     - Issuing a W-2 to the owner and other employees at year-end.
     - Filing Form 940 for federal unemployment taxes (FUTA).

### 5. **Risk of IRS Audit**
   If the IRS reviews the business tax filings and notices inconsistent payroll tax payments or improper classification of the owner’s compensation, it could trigger an **audit**. This could lead to:
   - **Reclassification of payments**: The IRS might reclassify the so-called salary as distributions, subjecting them to self-employment taxes instead.
   - **Fines and back taxes**: If payroll taxes were underpaid, the IRS could demand back taxes, penalties, and interest.

### 6. **State-Level Implications**
   Some states have their own payroll tax rules that mirror federal law, so the owner might also face state penalties for improper payroll tax withholding. States like California or New York, for example, have strict payroll tax enforcement.

---

### Summary of Key Implications:
1. **Tax misclassification**: The payments may be reclassified as distributions subject to self-employment tax.
2. **Underpayment of payroll taxes**: Without paying the employer portion of taxes, the business is underpaying Social Security and Medicare taxes, leading to penalties.
3. **Penalties**: Failure to remit the full payroll tax amounts can result in fines and penalties, including the Trust Fund Recovery Penalty.
4. **IRS scrutiny**: Incorrect payroll filings or improper salary payments can raise red flags and lead to audits.

### Next Steps:
If the LLC owner wants to properly pay themselves a salary, they should consider electing S-Corporation status. This would allow for a true salary, with appropriate employee and employer payroll taxes being withheld and remitted. Until that election is made, the owner should take distributions, report income on their personal tax return, and pay self-employment taxes.

If they’ve already been paying themselves a salary incorrectly, it might be a good idea to consult with a CPA or tax professional to correct the situation before the IRS notices.

Dania Debrief

Had lunch with Steve and his fiance (Dania Batiste, who will be another 1040c) to talk through their tax situation.

Dania will be a lot of tax poop clean up on the tax side, then a return (maybe 2023 and 2024), and bookkeeping for her side businesses. 

She has an ECommerce business on Etsy where she will create (or take) designs and print them on clothes that is manufactured by a printing shop which is sold via Etsy and another where she works with Companies and takes their designs and puts them on Mugs and shit.  I know Michalene has used Etsy before so maybe she'll be a new vendor! 

We talked through different easy strategies such as car mileage, home office, etc.  It was more of an educational close similar to others.  Honestly lit it up with rizz and think they'll throw us the keys.  Also talked about the value of having a good accountant for Entrepreneurs like themselves.  They said they've been trying to find a younger accountant as they are both trying to create YouTube channels and explained that old CPAs don't even understand how making money on the internet works.  

I'll create Dania's work in a separate Karbon item because they aren't married yet but are Married Filing Separate.  Dania has a W2 job but has also started an ECommerce business on Etsy that's doing very well (from what I'm told).  She was really excited to be actually working with a competent accountant and asked ""Would you file taxes too?"" which I thought was an odd question until I heard her history working with CPAs.  When she was a lot younger, and first started filing taxes she went to a CPA who said that she had a bookkeeping business which was losing money so she got a refund of like $5k.  She has never done bookkeeping before and she got audited.  The CPA ended up going to federal prison and I'm told that accountant is in jail to this day.  She paid all that money back but this year she had an accountant referred to her but after the initial conversation, she hasn't heard from him since and doesn't know if her taxes are filed.  She said she found him in a Facebook group and I asked if it was David Winter.  She said it wasn't but she's seen that name a bunch with not a lot of good reviews.  She admitted she was a hot mess and I said ""we've seen worse"" but she said it's also still her fault for being neglectful of this side of her adult life.  She had a traumatic experience with taxes and think she gets PTSD getting audited so she's just been whistling past the graveyard ever since.  She'll need a POA to get this squared away and probably her 2023 return filed.  

Also asked about QuickBooks and explained all the benefits of that and they were both all in on that idea.  They said they have a credit card and a bank statement where ALL of their business activity go through and there's nothing else attached to it.  That's the dream.  QBO set up should be cake which will definitely help with the taxes.  

Mark's out this week so I'll throw together a Quote/Proposal for this one but they'll both need QBO set ups, BKPG, Taxes, and a POA.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,mark.dwyer@mottafinancial.com,NV_BATISTE_0000,Tax - Ind. w/ Sch C (1040 + Sch C),2024,Standard Tax Deadline (4/15),"See debriefs from

Dania Debrief

Had lunch with Steve and his fiance (Dania Batiste, who will be another 1040c) to talk through their tax situation.

Dania will be a lot of tax poop clean up on the tax side, then a return (maybe 2023 and 2024), and bookkeeping for her side businesses. 

She has an ECommerce business on Etsy where she will create (or take) designs and print them on clothes that is manufactured by a printing shop which is sold via Etsy and another where she works with Companies and takes their designs and puts them on Mugs and shit.  I know Michalene has used Etsy before so maybe she'll be a new vendor! 

We talked through different easy strategies such as car mileage, home office, etc.  It was more of an educational close similar to others.  Honestly lit it up with rizz and think they'll throw us the keys.  Also talked about the value of having a good accountant for Entrepreneurs like themselves.  They said they've been trying to find a younger accountant as they are both trying to create YouTube channels and explained that old CPAs don't even understand how making money on the internet works.  

I'll create Dania's work in a separate Karbon item because they aren't married yet but are Married Filing Separate.  Dania has a W2 job but has also started an ECommerce business on Etsy that's doing very well (from what I'm told).  She was really excited to be actually working with a competent accountant and asked ""Would you file taxes too?"" which I thought was an odd question until I heard her history working with CPAs.  When she was a lot younger, and first started filing taxes she went to a CPA who said that she had a bookkeeping business which was losing money so she got a refund of like $5k.  She has never done bookkeeping before and she got audited.  The CPA ended up going to federal prison and I'm told that accountant is in jail to this day.  She paid all that money back but this year she had an accountant referred to her but after the initial conversation, she hasn't heard from him since and doesn't know if her taxes are filed.  She said she found him in a Facebook group and I asked if it was David Winter.  She said it wasn't but she's seen that name a bunch with not a lot of good reviews.  She admitted she was a hot mess and I said ""we've seen worse"" but she said it's also still her fault for being neglectful of this side of her adult life.  She had a traumatic experience with taxes and think she gets PTSD getting audited so she's just been whistling past the graveyard ever since.  She'll need a POA to get this squared away and probably her 2023 return filed.  

Also asked about QuickBooks and explained all the benefits of that and they were both all in on that idea.  They said they have a credit card and a bank statement where ALL of their business activity go through and there's nothing else attached to it.  That's the dream.  QBO set up should be cake which will definitely help with the taxes.

Already talked to Steve briefly via telephone so got background on him but had a more in depth conversation about both of their situations.  Dania will be a lot of tax poop clean up and Steve is more or less similar to my tax return in 2023 where he's starting a business and will have income streams coming from different directions (Salary, Unemployment, 1099 income, cash income, etc.).

Talked to my Aunt about the PY taxes and part of the conversation was how QB Payroll isn't the best at reporting and meant for smaller companies so we're going to move them over to ADP.  Part of their issues from our tax review was that Payroll looks way wrong.  Could have been the accountant or QB payroll but I don't think either were high quality.  

Mark is moving Motta over to ADP so he can lead the charge on this transition as well with the assistance of Paul. 

We're also going to have to show them how to use the platform as well but I'd say target date to get them completely set up on ADP would be 12/31/2024.  A bunch of their employees got IRS letters because of this payroll issue (or also their mistakes so there will be payroll poop clean up).  

My aunt is the operations person so she'll be handling their payroll so they won't be a payroll client per se but I think they'll have the Accountant Package so think we'll at least be responsible for the accounting side of Payroll which is essentially ensuring they are properly set up in ADP then making sure the information is synced to QB properly.  

Mark, Matt, Paul, and Nick on this one to learn the process and also to sync up and price this one.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Consulting - $175 - $199 per hour,,,,,,,,8,"Nick, Matty, and Paul to come up with a price for payroll transition.

He's very happy with Motta and towards the end of the call said he's been through 4 different accountants and they've all been ass.  He said his most recent one was some guy named James that charged him $6,600 for the year which Ben paid upfront as an investment into the partnership and when April came around, the guy asked Ben to file the extension himself.  They found him in a Facebook group and some others reported the same thing. He's skeptical of accountants and we actually have access to his QBO so I'm not sure if we've ever talked to him about a bookkeeping relationship.  Matty / Mark to brief us on those communications. 

Note for the team but Facebook small business groups in local cities seems like the place to find these tiny small businesses.  Basically a channel of LOMAR BIZ clients if we want it.  

I'm not really sure how to approach this one because I'm not sure if he's looking for a bookkeeper.  We talked through Motta and how it's been valuable to business owners.  We can sync up on the huddle tomorrow on how to handle this next but he's gonna need both services but his company makes no money and we already have all his info and already had the close meeting.  

Part of my conversation with him was our idea from a few months back of a ""Small Business 101"" video series so he provided a lot of questions on that.  He said he has a friend who will turn it into a digital course but he's never actually worked with him yet.  I think this is a back burner idea for us and I'm also not sure I trust this loose referral.",https://app2.karbonhq.com/4mTyp9lLRWTC#/work/4fTr65p1JYM9,,,,,
"Oct 1, 2024",Prospect/Client,No,,,,,,,,,,No Work Item Needed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Had a call (via cell) with Garrett on Monday September 30th for Pawz Inc. He was on the Bachelor's Party with one of the Monmouth Baseball guys but he wasn't one of those frat boys, he actually doesn't drink.  Turns out, he married the Bachelor's (Harry Paytas) sister earlier this year.  He also started his own LLC and purchased a retail operation this year.  Very busy 2024 for him.

He was a super nice and well spoken.  You can tell he's a good dude.  He gave me background on his career but his family has been in retail clothing for a long time.  His father started ""Big Johnson T Shirts"" which is a company that makes those goofy tourist beach t-shirts that is sold in beach city gift shops.  Him and his sister worked for his father's company for the past 7 years before he decided to split off and start a company of his own.  He made it seem like it was a dramatic situation but that he gave his family enough notice before he ventured off. 

Since starting his own company, he purchased Pawz Inc which is a retail business that has been around since 2015 but has changed ownership 1 other time since it's existence, so he'll be the third owner.  

He said Pawz Inc did between $1.0 - $1.5M last year when I talked to him which makes sense cause he said he'd do between $250k-$500k but he purchased it in May so this makes sense.  He said they have been 100% direct to consumer e-commerce before but he's working on getting into retail and wholesale. 

He's currently the only employee and does not use an accounting system.  Garrett admitted that he's strong from the Operations front but doesn't know anything from the accounting / tax standpoint so he's been looking for bookkeepers (mostly local shops in the Maryland area).  I asked him what are the important factors for him as far as Accountants and he mentioned the education aspect saying ""I can pay whoever can do this stuff but looking to get trained on this stuff so I can know what I'm doing when running the business"".  I think he'd be the perfect fit for what we're looking for. 

He said multiple times this is not his area of expertise and don't think he has a personal connection with the other shops he's talking to so said ""You take the lead here"". 

I talked to him about our background, approach, and some of our success stories.  Also gave him a quick run down of the services we provided and our packages will reflect the services included.  He said he was just starting out and knows this is an area he needs to lock down but as this is new to him, he's unsure of what services he actually needs.  I think this will be an easy close from a client acquisition standpoint but a 'build the trust' client at first then we can increase scope as we earn said trust.  

For next steps: 

(1) I'm going to send him a thank you note and include our Bookkeeping packages (which Sophia is going to make pretty for situations like this) but also told him we'd be able to help with pricing a bit due to the referral from Cary.

(2) He asked for next steps and for me to 'take the lead' so said I'd send out a request list for docs to frame out the project and to gauge volume of transactions.  He said it's pretty straight forward but Nick knows this world way more than me so I'll defer to Nick related to pricing.  

(3) There are some action items I think we have to do for this proposal including:

[A] Creating Proposals for the ""Accountant"" BKPG package spelling out the various services we offer within the package.  

[B] Creating Proposals for the ""Bookkeeper"" BKPG package spelling out the various services we offer within the package.  

[C] Creating a ""Success Stories"" for Adzemen Demo to demonstrate that we can work with Entrepreneurs with limited accounting background where we partner with them and help them grow.",https://app2.karbonhq.com/4mTyp9lLRWTC#/work/4dhN72JJtDsx,,,,,

Holly is a doctor from Pittsburgh, PA.  He's currently doing his Residency in Emergency Medicine.  You don't make shit for money as a Resident.  I think he makes like ~$75k a year while working 70-80 hours a week.  He'll be wrapping up his residency in a little less than 1.5 years but might be sooner. 

I'm looking at this like an INDY LOMAR for 2024 and maybe 2025 from a tax prep standpoint but with some tax and financial planning.  He asked what is the purpose of starting with us now vs later because he doesn't really have any money to save or anything right now, I told him it's never too early to start planning and if he anticipates to go from $75k to $250 - $500k, he's going to get phased out of a lot of benefits or savings tools quick so it would be efficient to take advantage of those while he still can and at the same time start building a personal financial infrastructure for when his income significantly increases.  

I talked to him originally from the bachelor's party from last weekend and he's in Vegas this weekend (9/28) for a conference with some of his co-workers so I'm meeting up with him this weekend to close on this deal. 

Assigning this for Mark for long term MWM prospect but also as a planning FGA.  People like Holly and some of our other clients (Mikey, Cary, etc.) who are high income lomars from a tax perspective so real value will be from a financial planning standpoint.  I think it would be good to start to strategize (at a basic level) for Tax / Financial Planning with the ideal of ""selling"" a full on financial plan when their situations really pop off.  Some of the prospects potentially already need a Financial Plan but too young and not in the stage of life where they know what their long term goals are.

We don't even have the software yet so lots of building to do on this side of the house and also think we'll run into a lot of INDYS that fall into this bucket so should start thinking about our approach as preparation for this season's hunting.",0,PA_LAMBERTON_GRANT_1558

When we originally spoke with him, he wanted to make Partner at Deloitte but now he's done with that path and looking for the next move.  I think he wants it to be Motta. I told him when he chose the Deloitte path that I was rooting for him but you can't trust Big 4 firms to actually promote the most qualified people.  Aside from the realization that making Partner isn't a very high percentage play, he also decided he did not want that life anyways.  

I'm speaking with him on 10/17 and think it will be more of a long term recruit (I think he has a decently high price tag and not sure where his head is at when it comes to Start Up / Entrepreneur life.) 

Either way, Nick is elite on the tax side but we'd need more Nicks anyways and I don't think Nick was looking for Tax to be his long term plan with Motta.  Donald is a career long tax guy and was in Deloitte's National Office for tax.

This includes the tax credits under the Inflation Reduction Act that will be used once the plant is up and running.

Mark is a legendary Muay Thai trainer who works with a lot of UFC athletes.  He also works for the UFC on the production team during the fights as a ""Technical Advisor"". Essentially, he sits in a room of screens watching the fights and providing Joe Rogan with analysis.  He also works in ""Talent Acquisition"" and essentially helps train fighters and find good fighters for the UFC to sign.  I think he said he got Rob Font (Boston native) and Tecia Torres (our client) some of their first fights in the UFC. 

Mark confirmed what Raquel said but the MMA industry doesn't have the same infrastructure for athletes as the NFL, NBA, etc. have thus there isn't really a lot of great advisors from an Agent, Manager, Financial Advisor type of role and Mark finds himself helping a lot of fighters out on the business side.  He's been trying to find a solution to help the athletes and we had a GREAT conversation about philosophies, the industry and how Motta aligns with that he's looking to fix.  

Mark asked me to stop by the gym while I'm home and tentatively planning to do that Wednesday but adding a work item to keep the notes from the conversation. 

He also asked that I don't share his phone number with anyone so the contact information will be for his gym Sitodtong USA which translates to ""Student of Dtong"".  He says he has 21 locations.  He was certified as the US representative for Muay Thai kickboxing in the US and think their gym is among the top gyms for fighters looking to develop Muay Thai kickboxing skills.  

Not 100% sure I'll be stopping by the gym but thinking there is opportunity to build a good network of UFC fighters as clients.  I.e. Mark has a network of fighters and he can white label our services under his.

Steve is an iGaming recruiter (gaming as in gambling not video games).  He worked for an agency in 2024 but was laid off and now he's doing it on his own.  He had a couple small W2s and 1099 jobs throughout 2024 while he was putting together his iGaming Consulting company, SIV Enterprises.  This includes creating a YouTube channel for iGaming. 

He also has a iGaming Proxy Service where he facilitates his clients who want to enter contests put on by the various casinos.  You have to be in the state at the time of the bet thus he facilitates the transaction. 

He said he's seen a little below $19k in sales this year all in (YouTube, Recruiting, Proxy) but I'm unsure when he started.   

He called ahead of our meeting next week because he is looking to enter a season long NFL contest and asked if he'd be able to enter on behalf of the business.  Essentially, his business is to 'sell' these contests thus his argument is that this would be R&D.  I can't speak to the compliance on the gaming side of the house but in my view, I'd say it'd be the same as a restaurant critique eating at a restaurant he's reviewing.  I think the same rules would apply (i.e. can only offset losses from gaming income) but think it makes sense.  Contest is this Saturday (9/14) so looking for some quick research.

Additionally, Jeremy's financial situation, including his pass-through business and personal income sources, were discussed, with Nick advising on the tax implications of certain transactions.

Next steps
• Jeremy to send Nick a copy of his 2022 tax return and all relevant 2023 tax documents, including K-1s and loan interest information.
• Nick to review Jeremy's tax documents and provide a quote for preparing Jeremy's 2023 personal tax return.
• Nick to double-check if tax return preparation is included in the current contract between Jeremy's businesses and Moda.

Discussing Moda Accounting Contract Bundling

Jeremy and Nick discussed their current accounting contract with Moda. Jeremy expressed interest in potentially bundling their current contract to reduce costs. Nick confirmed that Moda handles all the accounting and bookkeeping, including tax returns, which are an additional cost. Jeremy clarified that he is associated with only one of the seven entities included in the contract, which is Motivation Health Partners, the parent company of Symmetry. Nick agreed to review the details of the contract to confirm the current arrangement.

Personal Tax Discussion and Preparation

Jeremy and Nick discussed their personal tax situations. Jeremy was uncertain about how to handle his personal 2023 taxes, especially regarding the K-1 forms from a business. Nick clarified that the K-1 forms indicated the key ones from the business that should be included in Jeremy's personal tax return. Jeremy confirmed that he had no other significant personal income sources, except for monthly payments from a loan. Nick advised that any interest earned from the loan would be subject to tax. Jeremy also mentioned his financial situation, including his pass-through business and his wife's lack of income source. Nick requested Jeremy to send his 2022 tax returns and 2023 documents for preparing a quote.

Check the timeline for background but essentially left Amazon where she was for 20 years and has a TON of stock options.  She sold some off last year to purchase a house in cash and got sticker shock when she got her tax bill from it. That's when she got in touch with Joe.  

She's planning to sell more off in order to potentially open a retail business or invest in more real estate with her sister via the Battle Born Equity Partners business.  Her sister is a real estate broker which is the inspiration for the real estate side and they also purchased a pizza place with the LLC and has had to go through massive renovations.  

Her sister's current CPA is counting the TOTAL commissions on her sales as part of her income but she just gets a percentage via broker fee.. unless he's offsetting the rest of the commission somewhere, I think she's probably paying a lot more tax than she should.

This will probably be a stock evaluation client similar to what Mark was working on so assigning him this one as well.  She said her sister is also looking for a new CPA with her couple of businesses so could be an easy referral.

Check the timeline for background but essentially left Amazon where she was for 20 years and has a TON of stock options.  She sold some off last year to purchase a house in cash and got sticker shock when she got her tax bill from it. That's when she got in touch with Joe.  

She's planning to sell more off in order to potentially open a retail business or invest in more real estate with her sister via the Battle Born Equity Partners business.  Her sister is a real estate broker which is the inspiration for the real estate side and they also purchased a pizza place with the LLC and has had to go through massive renovations.  

Her sister's current CPA is counting the TOTAL commissions on her sales as part of her income but she just gets a percentage via broker fee.. unless he's offsetting the rest of the commission somewhere, I think she's probably paying a lot more tax than she should.  The CPA also said that they weren't allowed to deduct the money they've invested into renovating the business or the expenses on their business? I'm not sure his rationale behind that.

He says he left the accounting world behind and working in FP&A.. which I would argue is still accounting.  

He's looking for work and has been applying elsewhere but intrigued by what we have going on.  No tax background and unsure of what he's looking for as far as comp.  He said he'd be open to part time roles or keeping the conversation going. 

I think our Resource Pipeline is decently full so I don't know what we have available but I do think this could be a good FGA for internal interview process.  Not sure if we have a template for that but thought Ant had created some sort of application / questionnaire at some point.  Also think we can build out a Work Template to ask for resume and basic hiring info (again, we might already have this) but also to work through the hiring process so let's schedule some time for Peary to speak with you and Matty and see if there's any opportunity / fit.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Similar story to other people we talked to, Alex is tired of corporate world dangling carrot that you never get to eat.  He is open to a career change and looking for a company that he can get behind and his contribution can be more meaningful.

Still wasn't able to get a lot of rizz going but still a good meeting.  I gave myself a C and Matty (who listened not on the call but in the background) said B+.  He's an easy grader though. 

Alex is a tax planning client who is essentially a consulting firm in the fire protection space.  They sound similar to us where they are essentially 100% virtual with clients and resources across the US.  

They said they had an ""accountant"" but he said bookkeeping specifically.  I'm not sure if he has a tax guy so said the conversation was around tax planning.  

Alex & Andy said they are experiencing tremendous growth and was about to get whacked with a huge tax bill last year so they paid out 25% of employee wages in Q4.  They are looking to help build a tax strategy that is more proactive vs reactive.  

He talked about fee structure and I explained that this is generally an intro call and next steps are that we would request some high level documents in order for us to see how much there is to plan for and what they already have in place.  Told him we can either propose a plan for a ""Per plan fee"" or if you hire us to help implement these strategies than it would be an itemized fee for each part of the plan we implement.  

Matty and I brainstormed a couple strategies (mostly Matty) of: 

(1) Fringe benefits - Things like paying for employee phone, internet.  You're investing in your own people and this could be a good retention, culture, and recruiting tool which are all critical in fast growing start ups. 

(2) Investing infrastructure.  Not sure the compliance requirements for their business or where they are looking to grow but similar to 3PM, they are a consulting firm so if they were to eventually sell, there isn't really much to buy so ROI is lower.  But an idea is to pay for the licensing / registrations for expansion because you're reinvesting into the business and if they were to sell, they are selling the nation wide infrastructure.  Basically creating an asset.  

(2) Low level but if they want to do the profit share plan, at least implement a % profit so even having their plan be more pro active. 

They said they have a 401k and talking through Profit Share options as I took a shot with SEP IRAs and they also brought up another CPA suggesting they buy a farm.  Matty said the additional work in a different industry is not worth it unless you have the time/infrastructure.  I think the plans we brainstormed alone are ways to get the same benefit but create more value into the business.  

I also think we can kick the tires on the Intuit Tax Advisor software if there are any kind of visualizations we can use for this.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,S-Corporation Income Tax Return (1120S) - $1125,,,,,,,,,,,,,"See debrief about fee structure but think we do $1,500 - $2,000 gross based on what people feel like the market would rate this product and the time/expertise for crafting a tax strategy like this.",33,MA_Riley_0587
